    "text": "↞⇼↠\nCassie shut the door behind her. She breathed and leaned against the thick wood for support, her arms trembling. Slowly, she attempted to move back to her table, but her knees suddenly gave out and she collapsed to the floor. A sob rose in her throat, but she muffled it with her sweater sleeve, and her eyes burned with fresh tears. A small mistake. That’s all it was. I fixed it with tea. I said sorry. Surely, I won’t be punished further for simply not explaining myself. She drew herself up and rushed over to her sparse workspace down the hall, trying to sit in her chair before Odin’s posted door-guards noticed her outburst. \nFear hammered her heart. Her thoughts skipped, turbulent, panicked, tumbling, churning, bumbling. The only solid thought she could hold onto in the storm: Screw Odin. \nAnd: I need to visit my brother and parents one more time. One more time, tonight, before Odin discovers who they are. I need them to know I love them, and I’m sorry there isn’t any way I could help them more."

    "text": "Just as the next wave crashed, Adonis Mirkwood was mixing his sugar cookie dough and attempting to sing in high alto and horribly off-key “Switching Positions” by Ariana Grande. Adonis missed Sammy while he was on his vacation, but Sam had just solved a hard case on a missing child and was taking a well deserved break in the tropics, near his hometown.\nSam and Adonis had been best friends since university, when they were in economics class together. They, by chance, had been partners on a project and found out that both of their nicknames were ‘Wood’ because of their last name. After that awkward discovery, the two had been an inseparable pair of destruction and jokes. After uni, they applied together to Private Hiring, an agency with a very pompous air that its simple name couldn’t convey. They were both accepted as entry level detectives. Together, they slowly worked up over two years to become the private detectives they were now. Despite all his talents, Adonis is still an abysmal tone-deaf singer who is completely oblivious to his own voice.\n“Cookin’ in the kitch-” abruptly cut off by his violently buzzing phone, Adonis yelped in surprise. He answered breathlessly, “hello?”\n“Hey, Adonis! We got a new mission for you guys,” said Selena, their manager.\n“Oh? Me and who?”\n“Hey bro. I’m here too,” Sam muttered, annoyed that his vacation was going to be cut short.\n“Talk later. We have gotten many complaints and tips about this case, and we need you two to go in on site and stop this problem before we let it start. The site is about sixty miles north of where your apartments are, in a little mountain village called Briarcliff Valley. There are rumors of a man who is planning a bomb scare. We aren’t sure if this is a confirmed case or only many suspicions; we’re sending you just in case. The suspect in the case has complex security systems, so we are also sending a tech with you. Neither of you have worked with him, and he is relatively new, but his background check is clean and he went to an excellent school. If you accept, I need you both to be in the office in three days for the final details and preparations. And, sorry Sam, I know you’re on vacation,” Serena concluded.\n“Damn- I knew something had to go wrong while I was gone,” Sam groaned, dragging his hand down his face. “But since I’ll be working with my bes fwen, I accept.”\n“Aw, thanks bezphren. I accept as well. What’s the tech’s name?” cooed Adonis whilst shoving his cookies into his oven.\n“Contain yourselves. His name is Jeff. I’ll send you his contact info. Good luck, boys!”\n\nSam clicked off his phone and slowly stood up, stretching after sitting so long in the chair. At least I can go say bye to my family before I leave. Hopefully the case is bogus and I can come back soon. Wishful thinking. So many reports piled up typically means something important that will take some time to calm down. As he walked off the beach, Sam called Adonis again:\n“So why were you so out of breath when you answered the call?” bypassing introductions completely.\n“I was practicing my singing-”\n“Uh huh. Sure.”\n“Don’t patronize me. I was getting really into it and my phone buzzed out of nowhere and scared me.”\n“You get scared way too easily. Honestly, your phone’s buzzing got you so scared you’re winded?”\n“Leave me alone. What were you doing? Admiring your abs on the beach?”\n“…noooo”\n“Hah loser! I know you too well. Anyways, I gotta go. My cookies are gonna burn.”\n“Wow. You would really pick cookies over me,” Sam said sarcastically before hanging up."

    "text": "“Hello. My name is Jeff. How are you guys today?”\n“Hi! I’m Adonis. It’s so nice to finally meet face to face. You feeling ready for your first mission?” a stocky fellow of middling height replies. He has a wide but relaxed smile, and seems to be very peppy yet easy-going. Even though he seems like a talker (which I am not) I think I already like him.\n“And hey, I’m Sampson, but you can call me Sam,” Adonis’ tall friend says, extending a well-groomed hand to shake. He seems quieter and more reserved, most likely the more level-headed of the pair. “It’s great to be working with you. Where ya from?”\nI returned his shake. “I’m from a little hamlet in England. And, yeah, I guess I’m ready to go.”\nRunning out of things to really talk about, Adonis, Sam and Jeff got in their company-provided white SUV and started driving to the remote mountain town this whole mess started from. It wasn’t a long drive, but it was certainly awkward enough for Adonis to want to drive the car off of a cliff. Normally, Adonis did well in social situations and with Sammy, but Jeff made the air heavier somehow. He seemed pleasant and was polite, but he had a haughty way of carrying himself that clearly read he thought he was better than Adonis and Sam. He was a typical tech; self-adoring, overestimates their value (learning basic hacking was part of the agency’s requirements to be hired anyways), and much too quiet. Silences are always more silent when there’s a techy person around.\nAs they approached the site, they watched the landscape transform from a teeming metropolis to suburbs, rolling forested hills, to, finally, mountains sticking straight up to the sky. It started to rain lightly, and since it was early November, gold and red leaves speckled the trees and swirled to the ground. It would be a lovely day to go backpacking; unfortunately, I must go stabilize a bomb first, thought Sam. He loved going on nature hikes by himself.\nFinally, after a stiflingly quiet fifty-eight minute ride, the trio reached the top of a mountain and saw themselves looking down into a vibrantly colored bowl, with multicolored trees and lights turning on in preparation for night. This must be the ‘little mountain village.’ It must have at least four hundred houses! Adonis thought in awe. ‘Village’ didn’t suit the gleaming bowl of light amplified by the softly falling drizzle. All of the houses, most of which were almost big enough to be called estates, sprawled across the diameter of the valley, nearly six miles across. At the far end of the curved valley, a hairline trail led to a subtle gap in between the mountains. Although blocked from Adonis’ view by tall, snow-tipped mountains, a huge, silvery lake resided on the other side. While it was a far cry from a city, it definitely was a private and luxurious housing area only for the rich. One mansion stood apart from the main bulk, partially hidden by a thick pine forest with a wending drive leading up to its front. That must be the target house. It’s placement is just far too obvious. Adonis joked with himself.\n“Gameplan. Sam and I will do a perimeter sweep at nightfall around the suspect’s house. Jeff, I need you to tap into the security gates right now and disable whatever other measures they could have,” Adonis started to rapid-fire speak as he pulled the car off to a shoulder on the side of the road. A lookout, he remembered from studying maps beforehand. This shoulder of the road was named ‘Star-Chaser’s Lookout,’ and was the last place you could easily see Helena from before dropping into Briarcliff Valley. “Also, Jeff, if it’s possible, I also need you to change the guards’ shifts so somewhere in their schedules there will be twenty-five minutes of patchy guarding without them realizing it. This house seems to be owned by some rich billionaire scared of being robbed or something. It’s about a half mile in circumference. When we come back to the truck after the sweep, we should be able to assemble the camp and tents in a defensive location in under fifteen minutes. Got it?”\n“Yes, sir, Adonis,” Jeff replied.\n“Sure, brah. Whatever you say,” Sam said without even looking up from doing his facial routine. He had recently discovered the magic of good skin care, and was now addicted to having fresh, dewy skin.\n“So unprofessional! How did you even pass the entry exams?” Adonis snickered under his breath.\n“I heard that! And I’m still on vacation time, numbskull. Besides, I’m not the fallen angel here. Your texts are drier than California,” Sam called back.\n“Sammy boy, that’s completely unrelated-” Adonis yelled as he made a move to tackle Sam, “-and completely uncalled for!” Adonis and Sam started to throw punches at each other, Adonis for being called dry and Sam for being called a name he only let his mom call him. Jeff just sighed and moved off to the side, slightly uncomfortable with this display of friendship. He felt like a third wheeler in between their brotherly relationship.\nThey are kind of turning out to be pinheaded. I suppose just because you present yourself one way does not mean you are that kind of person. Rather amusing how fast it took them to feel comfortable enough around me to degrade their self-images. As Jeff spiraled deeper into his fatalistic thoughts, he found and began hacking into the estate’s database. After about five minutes, he easily had the code. He switched the guard positions and turned off the electric fence, set the videos to loop in the security cameras, and disabled the smart charging stations for the guards’ cars. Noticing Sam and Adonis were still play-fighting in the back with raucous laughter, Jeff clambered up to the front and guided the car down the rest of the mountain, to a deep and secluded area in the forest. This is going to be a long mission.\n\n“If you two don’t quiet down, you’re going to expose our position!” Jeff hissed from the outside of the truck. Meanwhile, Adonis and Sam acted as though they were tispy, giggling at every little thing. Jeff, a pluviophile, sat outside enjoying the light drizzle and finalizing the security measures so the two lovers inside the SUV could infiltrate and scan the perimeter. Finally, Sammy gathered himself up and tramped out of the van to look at the house through the dappled trees, still chuckling occasionally. Adonis followed suit a minute later, firstly walking deeper into the forest to relieve himself before coming back to review Jeff’s notes.\n“Sorry, sorry. We always let loose right before long missions like this. I swear this isn’t our normal state,” Adonis grinned. Jeff just rolled his eyes.\n“Ok, you should have twenty-five minutes before security rotates and will see you. Put on dark grey clothing to match the exterior, and keep your phones handy and on vibrate. I’ll text you three times quickly if I see someone coming, and four times if the cameras or fence come online unexpectedly. Got it?” Jeff droned.\n“Yep. Thanks dude. You’ve helped a lot,” Adonis nodded to him, then donned a grey sweatshirt. He jumped off the incline leading up to their camp, and rolled to the base of the hill where the fence started.\n“Thank you. See you in a minute,” Sam said collecting his snickers completely before somersaulting down the hill as well.\nNight was truly setting in, and the pair had slight trouble finding footholds in the fence at first, but finally squished their too-wide feet into the square holes. The cloud cover above diffused the moonlight into a silvery-white light everywhere. This barely-there light inhibited their sight, but also prevented shadows from being made and helped them sneak around. They scaled the fence within seconds, and landed feather-light on the damp grass below, not making a sound. Sam, who is good at memorizing directions, knew that they had scaled the fence on the north-east side of the property. Turning themselves so they faced the direction of the front of the mansion, Sam set a timer for twenty-three minutes; he and Adonis took off at a fast jog, staying fifteen feet away from the main house at all times. Sam kept a lookout, while Adonis, with his better memory, relaxed his eyes and took in every detail he could of the landscape flashing by. Camera, trimmed tree, flowers, camera, gardening shed, greenhouse, large wall, camera, pool, grass, gravel, small house, cars, motorcycle, garage, camera, camera, wrought iron fence, guard shack, light- LIGHT!\n“Quick, Sam, in here!” Adonis whisper-yelled, yanking himself and Sam behind a large potted fan palm. They covered their mouths with their hoods to muffle their labored breathing, and the large security guard ambled past them, walking leisurely and- Bzzt! Bzzt! Bzzt! The warning texts. Damn! Not NOW!! The guard’s head whipped around and stared directly next to them, and he flicked his flashlight to the highest setting and started waving it everywhere, getting closer by the second. Think! Adonis ran hundreds of ideas through his head, but the best one right now seemed- Bzzt! Bzzt! Bzzt! Bzzt!\n“RUN!” Sam yelled, and dragged both of them out of their hiding spot and sprinting away. They careened through the property, all the while the security guard screeching for backup into his walkie-talkie. Just as searchlights flashed on, temporarily blinding the security team, Adonis and Sam dove behind a rock and army-crawled to the forested perimeter. The only thing that stood between them and the outside was the fences, only three feet tall at the front, an easy climb; but the warning texts! Adonis stopped short and reminded himself.\n“Sam! The fences-!” Adonis screamed, but it was too late. In his haste, Sam had forgotten the fences had switched back on. He tried to whip his hand back, but his brain had already committed to the movement. His finger made contact, and electric sparks lit up the night. Sam instantly blacked out and fell over. Adonis ran over to cradle his head as he plummeted, then lifted his limp body, and with all the strength he had, threw Sam over the fence, just clearing the barbs at the top. Sam landed with an unceremonious thump, thankfully crashing in a lush pile of grass and dead leaves. Needing another way out, Adonis looked around and saw security golf carts piled up against the wall only 400 yards down, but out of the forest. Thinking of no other way, Adonis sprinted out of his cover and immediately heard shouts, running and the characteristic sound of rubber bullets being fired. In order to avoid the bullets, he leapt, rolled and dodged side-to-side without losing any speed. His long-time passion for parkour and gymnastics was really starting to pay off. He ran as fast as he could for the last twenty yards, then flung himself on top of the carts and catapulted his body over the fence.\nFor now, the chunky guards couldn’t follow him as they worked to get the carts ready and gate open, but it was not a major lead. Knowing he had three minutes at most, he doubled back to grab Sam, who was just coming to. Ignoring Sam’s complaints that he could walk on his own, Adonis scooped up Sam bride-and-groom style, and ran him up the hill as fast as he could. He looped back around the building, going back to where they first started the perimeter sweep, wondering how it could all go so wrong.\n\nJeff realized the moment he saw the searchlights flash on and sweep the buildings that Adonis and Sam needed help. He quickly ran to get his vitals computer, and pulled up the system hacking on the other computer to see where he went wrong.\nCrap. There it was. He had accidentally skipped a line in the shield, leaving a flaw that turned into a gaping wound. On the other computer, he monitored Adonis’s and Sam’s activity, trying to decide whether he should risk revealing their camp spot to fire one of his guns offensively. He noticed a huge and sudden spike in Sam’s heart rate, only for it to plunge low a second later. That can’t be good. Adonis is still ok though- deciding what he must do, Jeff’s hands flew over to his main computer and he began typing furiously into it. His goal: lock all gates so security could not follow them out of the complex, at least temporarily. He checked every pattern this time, and he made no mistakes as he was only focusing on one aspect this time instead of many security aspects. He glanced over at the vitals while finishing up the security hack; Sam’s heart rate was starting to look normal again, if slowed. He must have been shocked. Jeff finished the final code and stood up to grab water. He always got thirsty when he was anxious. He sat down a minute later, but jumped up again when he heard a loud rustling and heavy breathing. He grabbed a pistol, just in case. However, it was only a very tired Adonis carrying a very limp Sam."

    "text": "“Hi baby. I’ve missed you recently,” this girl seemingly made out of light, glass and elegance said in a slightly sleep-deprived raspy voice. She traipsed her way over to Odin and straddled his body with her legs, burying her face into his chest. He smiled into her hair and rubbed her back gently. Aspen-Fauna has been the love of Odin’s life since high school, when they became such good friends they decided to take their relationship to the next level. She was the first thing he thought of when he woke in the morning, the last thing he saw at night, his only weakness.\n“Have I ever told you how pretty your name is?” he whispered into her ear as they relaxed deeper into each other’s arms. “And why are you up this late? You should be asleep, baby,” worried he had kept her awake, but also selfishly glad she was here right now.\n“I don’t mind staying up. And you’ve been too busy recently; I miss you a lot,”she quietly said into his shirt, the fabric muffling her voice.\n“I’m sorry,” his voice breaking a little as he realized he missed her too. “I promise I’ll be more available next week. For now, let’s just cuddle a little longer before I have to go back to work. We had a bit of a security problem today, and I have to review this footage while it’s fresh.”\n“Okay,” she barely mumbled into his chest.\nOdin held her in his arms for a long time, watching the clouds thin to nothingness in the darkness outside and feeling her breathing slow. After almost an hour, he knew that he should put her to bed so she could sleep well, and that he must get back to his work. He took a deep shaky breath, admiring for a few more short minutes the precious girl that straddled his lap, desperately wishing he didn’t have to cut this off. Finally, mustering the strength he needed, he gathered this delicate pile into his arms and carried her out of his office to their bedroom. He placed her gently on the bed, pulling her covers all the way up to her chin the way she liked, kissed her softly on the cheek, and quietly left the room, smiling to himself.\nAs he walked over to the security wing in the house, he remembered highschool dating with Aspen-Fauna, the way everything she did captivated him and distracted him to no end. Odin was always the smart, slightly cocky kid in class who loved to be the most intelligent, the model student, the most admired. Aspen-Fauna was clever and pretty, and all the boys dreamed about asking her out, but knew they had no chance. She was funny and sweet, if a little shy and soft-spoken. Odin still didn’t see what Aspen was attracted to in him, but they were the best of friends in ninth grade, poking fun at each other, hanging out, and playing games on the weekend. He had always crushed on her, but thought she would friendzone him if he asked her out, so he suffered in silence for another year. In tenth grade, Aspen suddenly grabbed his face and kissed him while they were splashing water at each other in the ocean. Odin, of course, kissed her back, eyes closed and leaning into her fully. It was actually his first kiss, and he remembered each detail vividly: how her blond hair crusted in the salt water, how her green-blue eyes seemed to hold both the sea’s tempest and the deepest forest, how her light-blue tie dye swimsuit framed her body beautifully. Just thinking about that fateful day in the crashing waves seven years ago still makes him woozy with joy.\nOdin snapped back to reality when the door to security came up far too quickly, his happiness melting into seriousness as he rewinded the footage. Looking deeper into it, he noticed the video started to loop seamlessly, near perfectly at right about 7:00 P.M. until about 7:13 P.M. At 7:14, Odin finally saw a clip of the two tall agents running away from his garage, with the unfit night-shift security guard chasing after them while wailing into his walkie talkie. Bored, Odin looked away and thought of how he could convince the agents to either leave or lure them onto the property. They might need a quick trip to the basement; I think they know too much already. Odin continued to overthink his possible solutions until he glanced up and noticed the clock now read 4:00 A.M. Crap. I’ve spent too much time here. I need to go back.\n\nAdonis rubbed his bleary eyes and reluctantly pulled himself up from his cot. He had not slept well, tossing and turning the whole night from anxiety and the constant sound of the wind and rain. He sat on the edge of the canvas for a moment, attempting to wake up fully. Suddenly he jumped up, having almost forgotten about the state Sam was in. He pushed open the flaps of his tent and ran over to the ajar doors of the SUV, where a larger, nicer bed had been temporarily set up for Sam. Sam didn’t stir at the sound of his footsteps, and Adonis’ shoulders slumped slightly. Last night, after making it back up to the camp, Adonis and Jeff had called Selena and asked her what to do. Normally they would have called 911, but since technically the perimeter check was trespassing, and sirens would have revealed their hiding spot, calling Selena for advice seemed better. She recommended monitoring his heart rate, keeping him warm, and wrapping the contact area (where it left a burn mark) with sterile non-sticking gauze.\nNow in the morning, the sun just rising and the sky clearing from the storm yesterday, Adonis checked Sam’s pulse again using his wrist. Jeff still wasn’t up yet, so Adonis couldn’t use his vitals computer. Assured that Sam was doing alright, Adonis stumbled over his tired feet to the kitchenette to make some coffee and eat a banana. He sat on the edge of the van with his coffee, nice and black the way he liked it. Watching the trees shake off the water droplets in the breeze, Adonis waited for Jeff to wake up and ask him why the plan failed; in the craziness of last night, he’d missed the chance as both of them gave medical attention to Sam.\nFinally, after almost half an hour, Jeff walked into the camp from the perimeter. He had presumed Sam and Adonis would be raucous neighbors and did not want to be bothered by them, so he made his tent a little deeper into the woods than the other two. However, last night there had not been very much noise. Jeff stretched and walked closer to the kitchenette, but was swiftly grabbed by the back of his shirt and silently pulled away by Adonis back to the edge of the camp.\n“Why didn’t the security measures work last night? I thought you gave us the all clear and you said yourself we were good to go. So then why am I covered in scratches and Sam is passed out in the truck?” Adonis whispered angrily to Jeff. He was trying to be quiet so Sam could get the best rest possible.\n“I really am sorry. I made a mistake last night that I didn’t catch until it was too late. It was an honest mistake,” Jeff answered back slowly, glaring all the while at Adonis.\n“Aren’t you supposed to be the best in your field? Some kind of professional?” Adonis demanded of Jeff. Before Jeff could answer he cut in and said, “whatever. I hope your antics don’t get you fired,” shoving Jeff away and stalking back towards the camp.\nJeff stood still for a moment, angry that Adonis was blaming everything on him. He watched Adonis push the curls of his hair back that had fallen loose in his tantrum. Watching him be angry only forced Jeff into an even worse mood. He turned away from the camp, away from the prospect of breakfast, and stomped deeper into the woods. This isn’t even my fault! If only Sampson had not been an idiot and injured himself! And I AM the best in my field! I just made a small mistake! He wished he could go back in the past and change things so he could at least earn some respect from Adonis. He was the real pinheaded problem here.\n\nA breeze stirred the high reaches of the pine trees, brushing their needles together to create irregular music. Distant bird calls echoed between the trunks, adding their piercing chirps to the natural cacophony. Watery sunlight dimly poked through the boughs, stretching its weak rays to the forest floor. Mice and rabbits meandered among the trees’ roots, scrambling through detritus in search of nuts and seeds. Sampson stirred slightly in his sheets, slowly waking up from his slumber. His eyelids twitched and his brow creased while a fever-induced drop of sweat languidly slid past his temple.\nI’m dead, was the first and only thing he could think when he finally came to. His whole body ached, and he could feel fresh bruises around his body, as well as the burn mark on his hand. Realizing the pain likely meant he had not died, he lifted his throbbing head to look around him. He noticed he was in the back of the van, doors open, and Adonis was quickly walking back toward camp, his face reflecting a storm of anger. At the edge of his vision, he saw Jeff slink deeper into the forest, which was much brighter and alive-feeling after the rain.\nAdonis saw Sam’s head poking up, and walked over to him:\n“Hey. You were out for a while. Are you feeling okay?”\n“Not really. What did you do to me? I feel like I fell off a cliff,” Sam groaned quietly, finding talking made his headache worse.\n“I mean, yeah kinda. I had to chuck you over a fence. You’re lucky you didn’t break a bone. I’d rather have you covered in bruises than interrogated by that freaks’ police force,” Adonis half-chuckled, happy that Sam had finally woken up. He had been scared that the kitchen remedies would not work for the burn. “Anyways, you should still sleep some more. I think that’s when the body heals best.”\nAdonis gave Sam some more tylenol for pain, forced him to drink water, then let him sleep. He stood up and walked to the kitchenette to finish his sparse breakfast, barely noticing and hardly caring that Jeff had disappeared."

    "text": "“Odin, calm down! You need a level head to think this through!” Aspen-Fauna grabbed his arm and pulled him to the floor of his office, ignoring the mess Odin had made. When he raged, anything near him was thrown, and a lot of the time the objects hit her. Odin still boiled with fury and attempted to jerk away and stand up, but she pulled his face towards her and said, “look- look at me!” her eyes boring through his. “We know one of them was hurt by the fence and the other must be caring for them. You are correct that now would be the perfect time to attack them, but don’t try to do this with a half-assed plan!” she yelled at him. Although she was screaming furiously, on the inside she was shaken.\nThough he still trembled with rage, Odin calmed enough to listen to her. He sat, a doll submissive to Aspen’s tender hands. His eyes unfocused as his mind reeled with possible ways to catch the spies; although one was hurt, they had already proven their talents of evasiveness, and he wasn’t going to take any chances with their capture. He mulled over possible ideas, then pulled Aspen’s hands off of his cheeks, kissed her forehead, and walked out of the room, leaving her in the wake of his destruction. Without a backward glance he pulled the doors shut behind him and called for a full staff meeting in the dining room.\n\nAspen watched him strut out of the room and waited for the doors to close fully. She sat on the floor cross-legged, blood soaking through her sage-colored slip dress from cuts on her arms and legs. The maids had called for her nearly half an hour ago, when they saw Odin disappear into his room with a wine bottle and a hot temper. She had slipped in the room after him but in his fury, he had thrown the empty bottle at her, as well as books and anything else he could reach. Although Aspen dreaded calming him down from his drunken fits, she’d rather do it then watch some helpless maid attempt to.\nShe looked around sluggishly, barely noticing the blood covering her even though her head throbbed with pain. How did I get here? All her life, she had so many opportunities she turned down for Odins’ sake. Job offers, friends, parties, even art showcases turned away for Odin’s sake. This is all my fault. I had so many chances; I’m the fool for not taking them. What was I thinking? Although it was late morning and sunlight streamed through the massive window on the wall, the room was shrouded in darkness and the distant corners seemed shadowy and intimidating. A single tear rolled down her cheek as she whispered a curse and gathered her legs into a fetal position. She stared at the dark oak floors. She thought, how funny it is that this wood can survive a hundred drunken fights when I barely handle one. The way her legs tented allowed her to see the circle of glass shards surrounding her, how beautifully the points caught the sunlight and threw it across the room even though they were broken parts of a larger bottle. She ought to see the nurse for her cuts, but Odin would be pissed if she ignored his mess. Sniffling slightly, she stretched out of her position, and started gathering glass in her hands, carefully picking up the shards so she would not cut herself more. She worked around the room, underneath his sword above the fireplace, near his bookshelves. She did not notice the trail of blood she left behind, nor her head getting lighter the further she went. Time passed, and she faintly heard feet tapping outside the doors, then the heavy doors opening quietly.\nShe knew it had to be a maid coming to check on her, and that they must be saying something to her, but she could not understand it. She looked up to the door, momentarily blinded by the light, and noticed the house outside the doors spinning peculiarly. Although Aspen could not make sense of the words, she guessed that they had asked if she needed help cleaning. Just as she rose up onto her knees and tried to say ‘No, I’m fine, I don’t need help,’ the floor suddenly rushed up to meet her in a blur of color. Her head thunked on the dark oak, the color drained from her face, her eyes rolling into her head. The last thing she remembered was the maid flipping her over and screaming for help, and the beautiful broken shards falling from her hands.\n\n“Cassie! Gather all the staff! Dining room meeting now!” Odin yelled as he stalked to the dining room. “And bring me my charts and notes! Quickly!” He practically ran to the room in his haste to lay out his ideas before the haze of wine made him forget a single detail. He rushed through the threshold into the towering room, so massive it can hold up to one hundred-fifty people at once.\nCassie followed right behind him, tossed the folders of notes onto the table, then dashed out again to assemble the staff. Odin slapped his palms firmly on the table, cut out of the same dark wood as his office doors, and hunched over his scribbled notes. Never taking his eyes off of the words, he shuffled through the papers, looking for a blank sheet, and started furiously writing all of his new ideas. He had a large map depicting his mansion and the nearby forest and he spread it over the table, marking it with a red pen. After nearly ten minutes of hasty writing and sketching, he heard rustling behind him. He allowed his staff to assemble behind him and then turned on his heel to address them.\n“As you all have heard, we had a security issue last night. Two agents from Private Hiring were on the estate, presumably doing a perimeter check or what not. I assume they are here to investigate the rumors of the bomb, which we all know is just that: a rumor. That being said, we can not let them leave and tonight we are going to detain them,” Odin droned this all in a bored tone, tired that he was going to have to explain his ideas to his staff. Though they were hand-picked, he still struggled to find patience with them. “First we’re going to pinpoint their location, which I believe is to the south about a quarter mile, based off of their tracks. I need the house security to stay behind in case they come here, and the other half needs to come with me. Circle formation,” he rapid-fired while motioning at the maps. “Cassie and helpers, go clean out a guest room in the basement. They need to be separated from our subjects. Helpers, dismissed. As for the capture plan…” he began to describe in detail as the helpers filed out of the entryway. In the distance he thought he heard a helper screaming, but he paid no attention to it. After half an hour of strategizing and planning, Odin gathered up his maps and notes and dismissed the security team and prepped for the night, which would hopefully end in a successful capture of the agents.\n\n“Hey Adonis, where’s Jeff?” Sam asked from the back of the truck. He had drifted in and out of sleep all day, and finally was fully waking up. Adonis popped his head up from a junk computer that he had been rewiring for fun.\n“Actually, I’m not sure. I had an argument with the idiot this morning, and since then he’s disappeared. I’m betting he went into town for some real food,” Adonis said, looking back down to the computer. “Besides, he’s being paid to do this. I’m sure he’ll be back real soon, if for no reason more than to get a big fat paycheck,” a touch of sarcasm entering his voice.\n“Oh, give him a break. It was just a small mistake-”\n“A small mistake that could’ve killed you!” Adonis’ head whipped back to Sam, locking eyes with him, fear in his voice. “I was scared Sam! I may have been too hard on him, but I was scared of losing my best friend,” his voice trailing into a whisper, gaze falling.\n“You’re gonna have to try harder than that to get rid of me, stupid,” Sam grinned from the back of the truck. Adonis just smiled and rolled his eyes. “You should apologize to Jeff when he gets back. He’s kinda weird, but he seems like a decent tech. Plus, he’s probably an introvert; I’d bet he left just because he was embarrassed.”\n“Alright, alright. I’m glad you’re feeling well enough to be annoying.”\nThey passed the rest of the afternoon in friendly banter, both ignoring the tension of waiting for Jeff to return. Adonis almost wanted him to come back just so he could say he was sorry for yelling at him; he hated the feeling of being mean to someone without correcting it. Nearly two hours slipped by before they heard rustling from the bushes. Adonis immediately stood up and hid behind the truck door, away from the noise, and pulled out a taser from an inner pocket in his jacket. Sam likewise adjusted, rolling to the middle of the truck and ducking in the shadows, cradling his bruised arms and chest. Adonis looked through the window, scanning the bushes and trees shivering in the breeze. He focused on a spot of the forest that moved a little too quickly, waiting for the person or thing making the sound to appear. Suddenly, a shoe flashed out of the underbrush, and Adonis ran over to them.\n“Thank goodness it’s you Jeff! I-we-” gesturing at Sam, who now sat on the edge of the truck. “-were prepping for some invader to pop in,” Adonis threw his arms around Jeff, who stood stiffer than a board, his face a mix of uncomfortableness and surprise.\n“Uh…hi,” Jeff mumbled, looking down at Adonis’ head of brown curls. He disentangled himself from Adonis’ hug.\n“Adonis, be more professional, you idiot. Sorry Jeff, he’s really touchy. I think it’s his love language, actually,” Sam chimed in from the van, still holding his arms close to his chest.\n“And, I also wanted to say sorry. I had no right to blow up at you earlier; I think you’re a good person and I was just freaked out about Sam,” Adonis scratched the back of his head and looked at the ground so he would not have to make eye contact with Jeff.\nJeff stayed silent through the whole exchange, only moving in between Sam and Adonis. He finally spoke, saying, “I accept your apology,” then walking briskly over to his tent.\n“Wait! One more thing,” Sam stood up and caught his wrist so he could not walk any farther. His sharp eyes cut through Jeff. “You were gone for the entire day. Where did you go?”\n“I wandered into town. I figured we could all use some fresh air and time apart,” he snapped, grabbing his wrist back, and stalking into his tent, still upset over the events from the morning.\n“That went well,” Sam chuckled. “Oh well, I’m sure he just needs some time, and he’ll forgive us. For now let’s just make dinner and go to bed.”\n\nI heard rustling in the bushes and immediately shot up from my bedroll. Jeff is back; it’s the middle of the night. After a second of thought, I reasoned, It’s probably just an animal. No one could be out here. However, I still rustled myself awake and turned to Sam, who I was sleeping next to in the van to watch over him.\n“Sam! Wake up! There’s noise outside of the truck,” I whispered, shaking his shoulder. Sam sat up, and slipped off his elevated cot to sit on the floor next to me. “Should we go wake up Jeff?”\n“Shh Adonis! It’s probably nothing anyways,” Sam murmured, though I noticed he reached for a gun from a cabinet to his right.\nWe sat tense, watching for any sign of movement outside the doors. Thirty minutes slipped by, then an hour, and everything seemed fine.\n“I guess it was nothing. Let’s go back to sleep-” suddenly the world exploded in color and sound. Our doors were ripped open, flashlights shined in our faces, and burly guards grabbing us and ripping us out. “Let go of me! Who are you?” I shouted, trying to fight them off, kicking at their faces and scratching their arms. They refused to answer me.\nTo my left, Sam screamed in pain as they groped his bruises.\n“We have them captured!” a male, who appeared to be their leader, called from the center of a circle that the brutes formed. Directing himself towards us, he said, “drop your weapons. Now.” Turning away, “give them a pat down. Make sure nothing is hidden on them.”\n“Stop! Who are you?” I demanded of the men. I stopped fighting long enough to glare up at the apparent leader, squinting at the bright lights shoved in my face.\n“That’s not for you to know at the moment. What are your names?”\n“I don’t want to answer that,” glancing around, I locked eyes with Sam, who still had not talked yet.\n“Answer, or we will use force,” the man drawled in a bored tone. With both my arms held behind my back, and my feet slightly hovering above ground, I suppose I’m in no place to bargain. I looked back to the floor.\n“Adonis. Adonis Mirkwood,” I spat.\n“And I am Sampson Woodlark, sir,” Sam tagged on the end, voice dripping with concealed rage, his anger breaking through his pain from being manhandled. “And if it’s your purpose to apprehend us, I suppose you should know that there are three of us. It seems our tech was too smart for your maggot-riddled brains,” contempt curling his face into a smirk, his eyes flashing dangerously as he raised his head to look at the captain for the first time.\nThe man looked upon Sam with equal distaste, then waved his hand and said, “don’t worry about your tech. Secondly, you will learn to address those above you with respect. Your first lesson starts now.” He nodded to guards on either side of Sam and I. I glanced at Sam, but before I could say anything, the guards raised their arms in unison and struck us with their elbows. Pain radiated from the back of my head, and my vision went blurry on the edges, swirled with colors, then faded to black. My back contracted from the blow, my knees buckled, and I fell heavily to the earth face-first, completely unable to stop my cheek from slamming into the dirt.\n“Tie their hands behind their backs. We’re taking them to the basement; make sure the children don’t see them. We don’t need them to know what’s going on.” With that, the circle closed in on the incapacitated agents lying in the soil, gathered them, and left the camp."

    "text": "Great. I have no idea where Adonis and I are at (I don’t even know if Adonis is here!) and I can’t move or see. Fantastic. I should check whether Adonis is here, but if I call and there’s guards near me, they’d know I am awake. Sam debated the issue, then decided it would not make a very big difference if they knew whether he was asleep or awake.\n“Adonis! Are you here?” he whisper-yelled, straining his ears for any kind of noise. He groaned again and swore as talking made his head throb. Did they drug me?\n“Yeah, I’m in here. What the hell did they do to us? It hurts to breathe,” Adonis responded through clenched teeth, chills traveling down his back and legs with every beat of his heart. His fingers and toes curled from discomfort.\n“How long have you been awake?”\n“I just woke up when you called me.”\n“Yeah, same. Let’s try to find each other?”\n“It’s gonna hurt, but sure,” Adonis agreed. “Try to follow my voice.”\nBarely inching along, Sam ignored the pain shooting through his limbs and crawled on his knees to where he thought Adonis might be. Adonis moved likewise and the men met in the middle, both collapsing and panting from the effort. Although they had each crawled less than ten feet, whatever the guards had done to them rendered them weak.\n“They either drugged us or beat the living crap out of us,” Sam huffed. “Do you have any idea where we could be, Adonis?”\n“I’m assuming we have to be in the mansion. The brutes must be working for the guy we were sent to check out for the bomb threat, but I’m deducing that the threat was a hoax to cover up something. Something big is brewing, I can just feel it. This is bigger than just a bomb threat,” Adonis paused to gasp air. “As to where we could possibly be in the mansion, I have no idea. I would guess somewhere underground because of the chill and darkness. The real question is how long we’re going to be here, and whether we can get out.”\n“I think the best thing to do for now is to wait and see whether we get checked on in the near future. Plus, do you think Jeff is in here? I hope he got away and is notifying the agency or something,” Sam whispered back to Adonis.\n“I bet he got out. He slipped away from us for a whole day, I’m sure he can probably manage a single phone call.”\n“Yeah, you’re probably right.”\nWe fell silent after, both pondering what we had gotten ourselves into. There was no need to try to escape; even if we got out of our bondage, where would we go?\nWe have no idea where we are, exactly who captured us, or whether help is on the way, Sam thought bleakly. The simplest solution is to wait until someone checks on us and see if we can get information out of them. If only I had my watch to tell the time…. He continued to lament the loss of his watch. Up until they were captured, he had always worn the watch his grandfather had given to him. Not having it on his wrist felt wrong, like he was missing a body part. I suppose no amount of wishing is going to bring it back. I might as well forget about it now.\nAlthough the agents could not tell as they sat in the quiet darkness, alternately sleeping and staying awake, nearly four hours passed before a door creaked from somewhere in the room.\n“Adonis! Did you hear that?” Sam whispered in an undertone.\n“Yeah. Wanna team up and tackle them?” Adonis breathed back, keeping his voice as low as possible.\nStaying as silent as they could, they stood together and shuffled around the room, avoiding the key of light that spread across the floor as the door swung open. Thank goodness my pain is fading, Sam thought. He shrugged and reasoned, or perhaps I’m just on an adrenaline spike. Whatever the reason, they had enough energy to creep around opposite sides of the room to meet the door-opener, whomever it may be. The shaft of light that lit the floor allowed the agents to see their room for the first time. It was massive, stretching so long that the far sides away from the door faded into fuzzy blackness. For all its length, the ceiling was rather low, maybe ten feet tall. Adonis and Sam reached the door, standing as mirror images on both sides of it. Where are they? Why haven’t they shown themselves yet? Sam puzzled. Finally, a large figure lumbered in.\n“Hello? Anyone in he-”\n“SAMMY! NOW!” Adonis yelled. They launched into action, sprinting towards each other in order to pin the man between them. They crashed together and all three fell to the floor, Adonis and Sam on top and pinning the third man with their weight, and the third man landing back-first.\n“What the fu-” the nameless flustered man was cut off again as Adonis shoved his shoulder into his mouth to muffle him.\n“Listen to me,” Adonis locked his cool brown and grey eyes onto the man’s scared black ones. “We know how to kill men without using our hands. You are going to answer my questions. If you scream or refuse, we can and will use force on you.” It was no idle threat. With two heavy, clearly muscular, men sitting on his chest, the nameless man had no choice whether to negotiate. His eyes flashed and his brows pulled together before he nodded consent.\n“Good,” Adonis grunted, shifting himself so the man could speak. “Where are we? Who has captured us? Why did you capture us? Who are you?”\n“You are in a basement. I cannot say who has captured you, but you’ll probably meet them later. We captured you because our master told us to. I wasn’t actually one of the men sent on the mission. I’m just a groundskeeper, I swear. I was just checking on you.” He tried to lift his hands to gesture to his large gut, trying to prove that he was just a gardener and nothing more. Adonis and Sam did not let him.\n“You didn’t really answer my questions. If you are just a lowly gardener, why are you permitted to see the prisoners?”\n“Well, I’m also a part-time nurse. My master sent me to make sure that neither of you had died.”\n“Well, thank goodness for that. I’m so glad that you have found out we are not dead,” Sam finally added to the conversation, voice heavy with sarcasm. “Are you going to answer his questions now?”\n“Please sirs! I cannot reveal more without putting myself and family in danger. I swear I’ve told you everything I can!” Sam and Adonis glanced over to each other. Though neither of their faces betrayed it, both questioned why his family would be involved in his punishment.\n“You better not be lying,” Adonis said cautiously, looking up and down the gardener-nurse, trying to see if he had a hidden weapon. He and Sam stood slowly and backed away from the man so he could stand as well. He was quite a squat, portly man who clearly had never been trained in self defense. He wheezed as he stood, clutching his chest.\n“I think you two broke something in me,” he chuckled nervously.\n“Sorry. You seem like a decent enough person, but we’re more focused on trying to get out of here than sparing you,” Sam said from the shadows he hid in.\n“I….I understand. I wish that I…” he trailed off. “Ah well, I suppose I should’ve been expecting something like that. Oh, and my name is Francis. If you ever need treatment, you can ask for me,” he told them while backing out the door.\n“Wait! Don’t go-!” Adonis was cut off by the door slamming and the lock clicking into place.\n“Well that went fantastic,” Sam sighed, plopping down onto the floor.\n“Hey, at least we didn’t make any enemies. And we’re hopefully gonna get to meet this leader guy soon,” Adonis replied. Silence settled over the pair yet again.\n\nFinally, footsteps could be heard echoing through the door from the hallway after an indeterminable period of time. Sam and Adonis perked up as they heard two ’Yes sir!’s from outside. They must have added guards after the last visit, Sam thought. Good. They should be afraid. If he had been anywhere else, he would have chuckled at this mysterious, all-powerful leader being scared enough of two wounded, restrained men that he would post a guard for each.\nWaiting with anticipation, Adonis and Sam inched closer together, subconsciously looking to each other for protection. With brows drawn down low on their faces, they quickly glanced at each other, steeling their resolve before they met this commander.\nKeys jangled. The lock slid out of place. The door swung in silently on oiled hinges. And Adonis and Sam sat slack-jawed, shock slapping them across their dumbfounded faces."

    "text": "↞⇼↠\nIs there anything sharp in here? Adonis wondered to himself. He had already spent the last hour wandering around his room, inspecting every corner, every cabinet, every window to see if there was an easy way out. His search revealed nothing too useful. Decorated in a minimalist style, everything was painted shades of white, with light-stained wood floors and two large windows. A large white canopied bed was centered on a large grey fur rug. On the left side, a bedside table sat with a gold lamp. On the right, a large potted fern partially dampened the light streaming in from the windows. A white dresser stood against the wall opposite of the bed with a seemingly remote-less television anchored above it. Looking out the windows, the closest ledge was a floor down, too far and too narrow to jump onto. Assuming Sam’s room is identical to mine, he doesn’t have an easy way out either. He had moved on from the main room and was now checking out the bathroom, surprised that he even had one. Why would Jeff give us such big rooms? Maybe he’s trying to bribe us in some way, he reasoned. The bathroom was also minimalistic, with a small succulent on the double sink being the only decor. The sink trough was a dark grey cut granite, with a gold faucet. A back lit mirror hovered above it, the edges rimmed in gold. To the left, there was a small standing shower, a toilet, and a single fluffy towel. Crap. There’s nothing I could use to get these ropes off. They’re starting to hurt, plus I really need to pee, so I better think of something. He frantically glanced over the bathroom again, then dashed back to the main room and looked it over, in case he somehow missed something useful before. Just before he decided to give up, someone tapped softly on his door. “Hey, I’m gonna come in if that’s alright,” a soft voice said. Adonis could barely hear them through the thick wood, but it wasn’t Jeff’s condescending tone. Deciding nothing bad could come out of it, he said, “Sure. Come on in.” He was surprised when the door swung in and he saw a delicate-looking woman standing in what looked like a very expensive dress holding a knife. “Hi. I’m Aspen-Fauna,” she said in her soft voice, walking in and turning around to close them in the chamber. She hoisted her knife and said, “I’m gonna cut your ropes.” “Aren’t you going to get in trouble for that?” Adonis asked in a concerned voice. He bent his knees slightly to be at her eye level. “Don’t you worry about me. I’m too important to get hurt too badly. Now turn around, yes just there. Now hold steady. I couldn’t find any scissors, so I stole this big knife from the kitchen,” she explained. After a few seconds of sawing, she said victoriously, “There! You’re free now!” She grinned while watching Adonis stretch his hands above his head, rubbing his inflamed wrists to get rid of the feeling from the coarse ropes. “Thanks. Those were really starting to hurt. I’d love to chat, but I have to use the restroom. Can you wait a second?” She nodded, and went to sit on the edge of his bed to wait for him. Adonis reemerged a couple minutes later, still rubbing his wrists and forearms. “Sorry about that. I’m Adonis, by the way. Now who are you exactly?” he asked while sitting himself on the rug. He sat in a loose position, his legs slightly crossed, thankful he could comfortably lean on his arms again. “It’s fine. I figured you wouldn’t want to sit in your own filth after you regained consciousness, so you’ve probably been waiting for that for a while,” she giggled. She stood and started walking back to the entrance. “I’m Odin’s wife, Aspen-Fauna. I’m not really supposed to be here, but he’s occupied for the moment, so I wanted to check on you guys. I know he isn’t always the nicest,” she glanced downwards, and a great, heavy sadness overtook her delicate features. Adonis used her small lapse to look her over, trying to understand this brave waif. His heart skipped as he spotted small red speckles on her arms and neck, and he wondered what they were. He let his confusion melt away as she recovered a second later, smiled and bade Adonis farewell. “Oh! And one more thing before I go,” she reached outside into the hallway momentarily, then tossed Adonis a pair of handcuffs. “Those are fake, but they look real enough. If anyone ever barges into your room, slip those on real quick. I’m going to check on your friend now.” “Hold up! Why are you being so nice? I mean, it’s greatly appreciated, but aren’t you supposed to be on Odin’s side? Or are you here against your will as well?” Adonis quickly stood and caught her forearm as she tried to leave. She flinched at the contact and he immediately dropped her wrist, not wanting to make her uncomfortable. “I’m afraid I can’t answer that right now,” she jerked her chin up and met his eyesight; the intensity in her teal eyes shocked the breath from Adonis’ chest. “But, I do want to help you two. Also, it would probably be better if you didn’t mention this, this meeting, to anyone.” “Thanks again. Bye, Fauna,” he said, giving her a wave goodbye. Why did she flinch at my touch? Is she ok? I probably shouldn’t ask. I don’t want to bother her; it’s probably too personal. Or maybe it means nothing at all? Maybe she just wasn’t expecting ‘the prisoner’ to grab her. And what were those specks on her arms and neck? Cuts? No, no, I’m sure they were just freckles. She probably just has some light, strawberry freckles. Adonis tried to convince himself that Aspen-Fauna was safe, but the longer he thought about it, the more certain he became that she was, in fact, not safe at all.\n↞⇼↠\nAspen slipped out of Adonis’ room and pattered over to Sam’s. I’m not going to be able to spend as much time with him as I did Adonis. The guards I sent are sure to come back at any moment. Aspen had sent the guards on a wild goose chase, seeking out the source of an imaginary sound she supposedly heard. Hurrying over to the other room, she tapped on the doorframe and asked, “Sampson? You in there?” “Who’s asking? If it’s Jeff, Sam is currently out,” was his muffled reply. “No, not Jeff,” she giggled and let herself into his room. Standing in the entrance, she told him, “I’m Aspen. I came to cut your restraints and give you fake ones. And now that I have proven that I am not Jeff, I think you can get out of your fighter stance.” “Alright then,” Sam said slowly. He relaxed his body from the taut position he was in that allowed him to bolt at any second. Even though he was not able to use his hands, his plan was to barrel into whoever was standing in the threshold then attempt to escape. I should at least let her cut my ropes. Then, if she seems threatening after I’m free, I could tackle and tie her down and then get out with full use of my hands. He turned around so she could reach his wrists. “Actually could you crouch a little for me? You’re pretty tall,” she asked, feeling slightly embarrassed by her shortness. “Of course. Thanks for helping me. Are you also helping Adonis?” he queried while she sliced through his ties. “I already did. And you’re free now,” she smiled as he turned around. They both stood rooted in their positions for long seconds until Aspen asked, “Sorry to be forward, but don’t you have to go to the bathroom? Adonis did, and you both were together for a while.” Sam stared at her for a moment, caught off guard by her question. Then his laughter boomed out, and he explained between bouts that he already had gone to the restroom. Blushing profusely, Aspen defended herself saying, “It’s not a silly question! And how did you do that with-” she cut herself off and caved into his guffaws. “Actually, I don’t think I wanna know!” Together, they laughed so hard Sam bent in half and Aspen rolled on the floor in her exquisite dress, the serrated knife cast to the side. “Ah-oh no! I have to go now! But thanks for the-haha!-good laugh!” Aspen quickly stood and rushed to the exit. They had been laughing so long, she didn’t know how long she had left before the guards came back to their posts. Still bursting with fits of laughter, she handed Sam the fake cuffs and instructed him what to do with them. “I promise I’ll return as soon as I can! I don’t know how long I have until your guards return. Goodbye!” “Adiós, Aspen!” Sam called, wiping the tears of merriment from his eyes. She quickly pulled the doors after her, twisting the lock. As soon as she backed away from the archway, she heard boots clacking on the polished floor, and very closely. Aspen immediately crouched to the floor, yanked out an earring and threw it underneath the trestle table that rested between the boys’ rooms. The guards rounded the corner, saw her low to the ground and cried, “Aspen! Are you alright?” “Oh, hey! Yeah, I’m perfectly fine. I just seemed to have dropped my earring here when I was telling you about that noise I heard. Would you mind helping me look for it? Odin gave them to me, and I’m sure it’ll only take a second,” she said in an anxious voice, throwing them a fearful look over her shoulder. Thoroughly convinced by her performance, the guards rushed over, one trying to ease her distress and the other searching frantically for the lost earring. Still chuckling from her encounter with Sam, she turned her shaky laughing into panicky tremors racking her body, her gasping breaths into husky panting. She felt slightly bad for tricking the guards; they were good, honest people who she was taking advantage of. However, she comforted herself with the knowledge that her performance was bringing her one step closer to helping Sam and Adonis. “Found it!” the second guard called from the table. Still on all fours, he crawled back to Aspen and his cohort and passed her the earring. Thanking both of them, she rose up with assistance from each of their forearms and wished them a good afternoon. As the guards assumed their formal posts, neither of them suspected that Aspen had done anything beyond lose an earring, nor that one of their hostages was now inadvertently armed."

    "text": "As soon as Aspen knew she could no longer be seen by the guards, she threw her hands in the air and allowed herself a reckless run down the hall. Presently, she struggled to feel any emotions, but sneaking around Odin and his guards made adrenaline course through her limbs. She grinned as she descended the spiraling stairs for the first floor. When Odin had left her alone earlier, nearly forty minutes ago, she had been tending to the indoor garden. Her favorite part of the whole property, the indoor garden was in the atrium, below the balconies, and lush with rainbows of flowers, potted and trimmed trees, leafy emerald-pigmented tropical shrubs and even a couple waterfalls. Whenever she walked amongst the plants, she could forget where she was and instead imagine herself in an equatorial escape. Sometimes, it was so easy to picture the dreamscape she could even see and hear the birds; other days she struggled to feel the imaginative sunlight warming her skin. Bunching up the skirt of her dress, she quickly walked over to the garden’s edge and meandered to the center of it to wait for Odin to return. At the center, a sunken pond with fish swimming in crystal-like water reflected the natural light from the atrium into her eyes. I wonder what Odin had to rush off to earlier. He said it would only take him a second, but it was long enough for me to sneak off, she thought while seating herself on the edge of the water. Leaning on her right arm, she splayed her bluebell-hued dress behind and on top her relaxed legs. She reached a finger out and slowly stirred the surface of the water, sending out ripples in every direction. She smiled as a fish swam up to her finger tip and nibbled on it. Without her noticing, Odin had walked into the center of the garden, and now stood at the fringe of plants, watching Aspen. He admired her slight smile as she played with the fish, and how the mirrored light made her blonde hair glow golden. He let her sit silently, swirling the water and stroking the fish for a few minutes before he made his presence known.\n“Making friends, miss Aspen-Fauna?” he asked, stepping into the ring of light around her. She sucked in a small gasp, and twisted towards him. Her smile faded slightly, and she retracted her hand from the pool and shook off the drops clinging to her finger. “Oh, hi. You scared me,” she said, rising from the ivory colored stone and brushing her dress straight. Odin proffered his forearm, indicating for Aspen to hook her arm around it. She complied and asked, “what took you so long? I was waiting here for nearly an hour.” “And that was very good of you waiting for an hour. I had some very important business to attend to, the likes of which probably wouldn’t interest you.” Aspen was certain that this business would very much interest her. Although she would love to pry, she also knew that he would not answer her, or if she pushed too far, she could incite him. But I wish he would at least stop talking to me like I’m a child. He seems to forget that I have the intelligence of a fully grown adult, just as he does. She walked in silence with Odin, not answering him or trying to start up the conversation. After traversing the whole mansion and ending up in the north wing, Odin finally talked again: “What do you want to do? I have some free time now.” “Are you sure that nothing will come up again?” Aspen flintily asked. Although she was annoyed at how Odin treated her, she also was extremely satisfied that she had made him talk first. “What’s with that tone? I disappear for one hour and-” “And what Odin!” she demanded, and wrenched her arm from the crook of his elbow, stopping them both directly in the middle of the hallway. Careful now, a small voice in her head reminded. “You never have time for me anymore! By heavens, you never even let me go outside anymore! Why can’t I go outside? That’s what I want to do!” She glared at Odin, trying to be intimidating despite being seven inches shorter than him. He pondered her words for a long time before he responded. “You’re very lucky right now that I love you. I love you, and that is the only reason I am not going to slap you right now for being so insolent,” he said in a perfectly level voice, only his fiery gaze breaking through his cool exterior. “But, I can’t deny that you’re right. I have been busy, and I haven’t spent enough time with you, and I’m sorry for that. As for going outside-” he suddenly had to clear his throat and look at the floor, then at the wall. “You can’t go outside because… I’m working on a surprise for you. But I promise that you’ll be able to see it within the month.” What is he doing? He hasn’t allowed me to go outside already for two months, and now three? She looked away, wishing that she was back laughing with Sam or being cared for by Adonis. “I accept your apology. I look forward to the day you will stop preventing me from seeing the real garden, and feeling the sun and rain on my face,” she caved inward, suddenly seeming much smaller and more fragile. “Of course, princess. Now, how about we go get something to eat from the kitchen? You seem like you could use a meal,” he turned and resumed walking. Aspen had no choice but to follow him, but she walked nearly ten paces behind him. She trailed after him to about the middlish of the wing, where he turned right into the cavernous kitchen. Odin glanced behind himself and waved Aspen forward. She looked around, taking in the familiar space; polished concrete countertops, polished exhaust hoods, two stainless steel refrigerators, bright LED lights embedded in the high, pale blue ceiling, and countless pots and pans suspended from aerial hooks. Odin walked up to the head chef and asked her what they were preparing, and whether the cooking staff had some to spare at the moment, perfectly polite and cheerful. Aspens’ eyes glazed over and she completely tuned out their conversation until she heard “…it’s strange, but one of our large serrated knives has seemed to disappear,” and snapped back to reality. She saw Odin start to twist towards her, and she quickly averted her gaze and studied a small, shriveled flower someone had placed on an exposed spice shelf. “…Interesting. I wonder how a whole knife could disappear,” Odin rhetorically asked. He readjusted his glasses and slowly turned back to the chef. “Anyways, if you could prepare a plate for my wife. She is hungry. And do it quickly now.” Odin stepped next to Aspen and leaned on the wall behind her. “So, where did you have to go earlier so suddenly? I was just about to show you my botanicals but you had to dash out,” Aspen looked up to his face while asking, searching to see whether she could discern anything from his indifferent shell. “Oh, one of the guards had a family emergency, I had to go deal with that. I ended up having to depose him. A shame, really; he was fairly young,” he said while dragging a hand down his face, cradling his chin at the bottom. “Do you possibly know what could have happened to that knife? See or hear anything suspicious from the garden?” “No. I was watering all the roses and succulents while you were gone. It’s quite a complicated process, actually. You have to water them slowly, from the base and-” “That’s nice, Aspen. Grab your food the nice lady is bringing you, and let’s go upstairs,” Odin blatantly cut her off and dragged her out of the kitchen as soon as she thanked the chef. “My office, or our suite?” Aspen shuddered at the thought of having to face the office, his office again. She could still feel the heat of his words, the prick of the glass shards slicing her skin; it wasn’t far enough in the past to ignore it quite yet. “Let’s go to our bedroom. You seem like you need some cuddles after your hard day of work,” Aspen performed for him, fake pouting, appeasing him, distracting him. Anything to make him forget about the knife. “Thank you, Aspen. I know I can always count on you to make my day better. Want to play games together? For old time’s sake?” “Sure,” Aspen said. Games are good, but I need to really capture his attention. He does not forget things very easily, especially about me. Aspen tripped herself on the back of her heels and cried out, “ah! Stupid heels. My feet have been so sore lately. Odin, would you mind carrying me up the stairs?” He peered down at her, chuckling lightly when he saw how she had landed on her knees whilst still clutching her meal. “Of course, love. You’re lucky you didn’t spill your food, with such a spectacular fall,” he said while scooping her up, precariously balancing the plate on her stomach while she laid her hands on his neck. “Thank you, Odin,” she whispered. His breathing became more labored as he ascended, passing through all four floors to reach the top. As he padded down the hall, he stared at Aspen through the thin lenses on his glasses. Aspen met his gaze and watched his emerald-green eyes narrow slightly, a crease furrowing between his brows, his breath hitching in his throat. She tilted her head up and kissed him on the mouth, letting her tongue explore his mouth. He arrived at the entrance of their suite and opened the doors using his back, then closed them with a swift kick. “I knew you were hungry,” Odin mumbled into her lips, placing the plate on a dresser then tossing Aspen onto their bed. “PC or console?” “Console, of course. I’m totally ready to absolutely annihilate you at fighting,” Aspen challenged him while bent over to slip off her high heels. “Set it up while I put on something more comfortable.” She returned from her private walk-in closet in an oversized lavender t-shirt, black runners’ shorts and fuzzy socks. Odin had the game loaded and had also switched his dresswear for a pale blue sweatshirt and black jeans. Odin and Aspen plopped down next to each other on the bed and spent the rest of the day alternately beating each other in fighting, racing or building games. For a short time, a few fleeting hours, they lived a lie. Neither Odin nor Aspen sat on the bed; only Jeff and Fauna. They bandied jokes between them, remembering the chaotic situations they always managed to tangle themselves into in high school. They embraced this lie, both craving the distraction, momentarily sending themselves back to easier times. Simpler times where Jeff was just awkward know-it-all, and Fauna still dreamed of becoming an artist. Even though it was all a lie, an illusion, it was, for a short while, a beautiful one."

    "text": "Sam was also beginning to feel bored. His initial surge of excitement when he found that Aspen had left the knife behind, whether purposely or accidentally, had long faded. Sam also discovered that the guard who had been initially assigned to him had disappeared, and when he asked what had happened to the young guard, none of the staff would answer. However, Adonis’ guard stayed the same. He struggled even more than Adonis with the food portions. He got slightly larger portions because of his height, but it still was not nearly enough to support his weight or muscle mass. After two weeks of the same treatment, he thought, I hope my muscles don’t atrophy completely while I’m here. I would work out, but I barely have enough energy to do anything but sleep.\nAlthough Aspen visited neither of them for almost two weeks, Francis did show up three times. The first time he came to their rooms, just one day after Aspen’s introduction, Adonis was so happy to see a familiar face he had to restrain himself from hugging Francis. “Francis! What are you doing here? I thought I was never going to see you again!” “I have lots of property clean up to do, so I can’t be here very long,” he warned Adonis, turning around and closing the door. “I think I’m lucky I even got through the guards! They do not want anyone visiting you two troublemakers.” “What did we do? Odin hasn’t hurt us that bad, or even visited us, and he gave us these nice rooms,” Adonis asked, still perplexed on why Odin would bother treating them like guests. “I’m not sure, but I have heard rumors…” Francis glanced at the door again, as if to reassure himself that it was still closed. “…I think he’s planning to use you both for something. Now, I have no idea what that is, but I find out, I might be able to warn you. Oh, and my real purpose for coming here was to bring you this,” he said, reaching into a satchel he carried and handing Adonis some folded shirts and pants. “It’s not much, and I don’t know if they’re your size, but I knew Odin wouldn’t arrange fresh clothes for you, so I took it upon myself to do so.” “I-thank you,” Adonis stared at the folded clothes in his hands. He smiled. “Thanks so much, Francis. Sorry there’s no way I can really pay you back for this.” “It’s ok, take care. I have to go back to my work before my absence is noticed,” he said cheerily, escorting himself out of the room. Francis visited twice more later, just checking on him and Sam and attempting to cheer them. Even though it was very nice of Francis to do so, Adonis still missed Sam and needed a way to talk with him. I could ask Francis to bring him into my room. No; that wouldn’t work. He’s surely already risking his neck just for these meetings, plus he would have to somehow distract the guards for a long time. He sat on the edge of his bed and tapped a beat with his fist on his thigh. He abruptly stood and forced a hand through his hair. Damn! I need a way to communicate! He stalked to the middle window and leaned straight-armed on the windowsill, glaring at the sharp mountain peaks in the distance. He looked down again, rethinking whether he could somehow drop down to the ledge. As he stared, his eyes refocused on the metal rain gutter just inches below him. He frowned at the gutter, then turned to the window and tried to jimmy the pane open. He scrabbled at the edge of it, trying to pry it open. It was painted all around, and he could not even tell which way it was supposed to open. I wish I had acrylics, he thought to himself while digging his nails into the cracks and slicing the paint. After scratching at the paint for almost fifteen minutes, he finally managed to split the panes from the wall. He braced his shoulder against the glass and shoved himself one, two, three, four, five and six times before the concealed hinges finally swung the window outwards. The window lurched so suddenly Adonis nearly fell out of it, but caught himself with his legs. Grinning, he leaned out and whooped victoriously. He stretched his hand out and looked left to see whether the gutter reached what he guessed was Sam’s room based on counting windows; the metal pipe wound around the house into the distance. Looking at the ground, he could not see any guards, which surprised him. Maybe the house is guarded outside only at night. He tapped the metal with the tip of his fingernail and listened to the echo it produced. Perfect. Noticeable, but surely not loud enough to be heard from the ground. He tapped rapidly three times, paused, tapped once and again and held, paused, and tapped and held twice. He tapped with all of his fingers, nearly slapping the metal with the flat of his hand. I hope this works. He continued the same pattern, pausing in between each one for a few seconds.\n↞⇼↠\nSam sprawled out on his bed, trying to find a new position to sleep in to entertain himself. He was bored of this big, empty, quiet room with no company other than the sporadic visits from Francis. He stretched and shook out his arms and legs, savoring the softness of his borrowed sweatpants and t-shirt. He reconfigured himself and threw his head at the foot of the bed, hanging it off the edge. He felt the blood rush into his face and hoped, maybe this will get rid of this killer migraine I have. His head had been pounding for nearly three hours now, and his vision was becoming blurry from the constant throbbing. Simply walking and standing exacerbated his headache, making him nauseous and faint. If only that stupid tapping would stop! There must be a woodpecker outside, he grumped. The last fifteen or minutes or so had been punctuated by the most annoying metallic-sounding tapping. He lay immobile, the blood rushing to his brain somewhat muting his migraine’s effects. As his mind cleared slightly, he listened to the tapping. It came at regular intervals, with quick taps followed by slow, and a larger pause in between each repetition. One, two, three quick…one quick, one long…OH! He rolled off his bed, ignoring the rush of sickness he had, and dashed to his window, leaning against the wall for support and waiting for the vertigo to disappear. He fought for air, gasping as dizziness constricted his lungs. Still weak kneed, he pressed his ear to the pane to listen to the regular tapping again. That has to be Adonis! I think he’s spelling…AMS? Oh, stupid. SAM. He tried to force open the window, but found it to be painted shut as Adonis had. He crouched and retrieved the knife from where he had hidden it in the potted plant, lightly covered in a layer of soil to conceal the shine. He easily cut through the paint and pushed it again. He counted the pattern and waited till the end before he tapped, trying to signal to Adonis he had gotten his message. One short, one long, pause, long short short, pause, long long long, pause, long short, pause, short short, pause, short short short. ADONIS? YES. SMART. THX. It was a painfully slow way to communicate, but without any other way, they both welcomed it. They stood at their windows tapping for more than an hour, asking if they each got enough food and trying to guess why they got such nice rooms. While they drummed, the sun began to set and the weather shifted. Clouds gathered at the horizon, towering behemoths with white tops and stormy-grey underbellies. The dying sun shone through in slanted golden rays, nearly blinding both Adonis and Sam with their brilliance. NIGHT COMING. STOP? Adonis asked while shielding his face with one hand. YES. RAIN TOO. TTYL. Adonis leaned out and grasped the edge of the bottom rail on the ajar window, checking the ground again to make sure there were not any guards patrolling. He saw a guard just begin to walk out from the guard shack, and Adonis was relieved they just managed to miss the rotation of the day and night guards. They must only patrol after nightfall. He shut the window and sank to the floor, still lightly holding its lock with the tips of his fore and middle fingers. We were lucky, he thought. He rose from the floor and flopped face-down onto his bed, groaning into his sheets and wishing that he had more food. His feet hung over one side, and he tucked them onto the bed as he flipped onto his back, eyes closed, hand running over his forehead and hair. He shivered and reopened his eyes, surprised by the sudden chill that had overtaken his room. Dread dragged his heart to his feet as he glanced out the window again. Snow swirled outside, languorously drifting down in fat flakes. Winter was here; but Sam and he were still trapped in a strangers’ house with no outside contact and barely any allies. It felt as though an impassible barricade had sprung up between them and the distant world.\nHours later, Adonis threw himself around on his bed, struggling to find sleeps’ clutch. Worries of the weather, what was going to happen to him and Sam, and whether Aspen was safe from Odin’s chaos plagued his mind. The more he tried to calm himself, the more he felt his throat close up and tears push against his eyes. He gasped and glanced at the clock again; it now said it was 2:34 AM. I can’t do this. I need air. He pushed his sweaty blankets off of him and leaned over the side of his bed, his hands clenching the sheets so hard his knuckles turned white and his legs shaking from adrenaline coursing through them. His thoughts whirled, clashing and fighting, a hundred versions of himself splitting off and brawling for dominance. He frantically tried to take control: I need to calm down! I can’t have another anxiety attack! CALM DOWN NOW! I can’t do it. Sam- is Sam ok? I wish he was here he always knows what I need. Focus you idiot! He’s fine! Everything’s fine you’ll be ok! NO! It’s not fine! I am not ok! I hate it here I am not safe this is not ok I can’t even think damn I hate this place so much SOMEONE COME HELP ME I AM NOT OK The voices battled in his head, spewing so quickly he did not know what to think anymore; an entire war battled within his skull, exhausting him without even moving. He gave up trying to rationalize. He let go, forgetting who he was and accepting that he only lived to suffer, and he would not make it out of this house, or anxiety attack, or his problems, ever. He cried, his face contorting, tears streaming down his cheeks. He wrapped his arms around his stomach and rolled to face the headboard, curling his legs and head into a tight ball, rocking slightly with the strength of his sobs. The world seemed so full of darkness; all life is and could ever be is a short dream before death. Silence suddenly cut through the clamor, and a single voice made itself clear. Someday you won’t even matter anymore. No one will remember who you are. No one cares about you. You would be better off dead already. Adonis threw his neck back and glared at the ceiling, his eyes and cheeks still shining from the warm saltwater tracks. His voice quivered as he screamed, “leave me alone! Stop! I’m not listening to you! I hate you!” He sobbed, his breath hitching in his throat and preventing air from entering his lungs. His head swam, and he collapsed inwards, crumpling to his bedsheets again. Try as he might, the narrative would not leave him alone. Stress from everything had built up and finally released, leaving him a broken shell of the person he was not seven hours ago. Convulsions still wracked his body and his feverish screamings were reduced down to whimpers. Adonis lay the loneliest man on earth, not one other soul available to comfort him. His brain dared him to jump from the windowsill; when he could not find the energy to stand, the sinister voice named him cowardly. One voice convinced him he was fine, he did have a purpose and he needed to live; another yelled of impending doom. The only thing he was sure of was confusion. Nothing made sense and it never would. He grew weary of wrestling with himself and sleep finally found him, brusquely tossing him into a monotonous unconsciousness, occasionally punctured with brief sensations of arms wrapped strongly around his middle.\n↞⇼↠\nThe spry sunlight reflected off of the tallest ice-laden pine branches, the sparkles shifting with the wind. Below the tallest canopy, the rest of the trees and ground were still swathed with azure shadows. One lonesome guard patrolled outside, their proportions seeming flat and their outline unfocused in the early-morning grey. Sam groggily pulled himself out of sleep, lifting his chin from face-down in the pillow to looking at the wall in front of his bed. He yawned, side-eyeing the clock to read the time: 7:12 AM. I should’ve shut the curtains, he grumped, annoyed that the snow crystals’ abilities to reflect light so spectacularly were interfering with his rest.\nHe slumped out of bed, taking his comforter with him and wrapping it around his shoulders. He stomped heavily to the window, deciding that if he was going to be up this early, he might as well enjoy the sunrise. He squished his forehead and nose against the pane, savoring the coolness seeping into his cheeks. With his scrunched cheeks slightly inhibiting his vision, he watched the shadows on the distant mountain tops melt downwards, golden light taking over the steep slate faces and setting the fresh layers of snow on fire. The lake of hammered silver gleamed anew, glimmering as the breeze played upon its surface. The sky acted as an aesthetic backdrop, the pre-dawn pale blue blushing into royal pinks and oranges, then fading back to a deep cerulean. A few swollen clouds left over from the storm the eve before scattered across the sky, matching the atmospheres’ colors and pairing them with some ethereal yellows. I love sunrises. They’re so calming, Sam smiled, pulling his face back and stretching, reaching for the ceiling. I hope Adonis watched this one. I know he had a bad night. I wish I was there for him. He shuddered and released his stretch as he remembered Adonis’ screams from last night. He was jolted out of slumber, and although Sam could not make out what he was yelling, it was clear that Adonis was having some sort of anxiety attack. I wonder if he’s awake by now. Surely, he would’ve slept lightly, if at all, after an episode like that. Sam quickly glanced out his window for a guard-check, then stepped over one window to the middle, which he had already cracked the paint on yesterday. He jimmied it open and stretched his hand down to the gutter, keeping his eyes averted to the ground to make sure no guards saw him. His fingertips settled into snow; one-inch-deep, fresh, powdery snow. Soft, lovely, and the perfect amount of mixed-in ice needed to pack snowballs. And the perfect amount of sound absorption to completely block any echoes a metal rain gutter could produce. Sam groaned and dropped his head, allowing his fingers to relax and curl out of the puffy drifts. Crap. I forgot about the storm! The overall loss of the rain gutter communication barely bothered him. The only thing that dampened his otherwise cheery mood was not being allowed to communicate to Adonis that he is special, a priority, and is loving and deserves to be loved."

    "text": "↞⇼↠\nThey continued to tromp to the library, the guards’ boots clicking loudly on the clean floor and Sam and Adonis’ socks gliding silently. Even with all the help Francis provided, he still had not managed to pilfer shoes for them. Their hands were again bound behind their back, but unbeknownst to Odin, they were fake cuffs this time. Sam glanced at Adonis, catching his hollow eyes. He mouthed, Are you ok? I’m fine. Sam looked away, wholly unconvinced. He faced Adonis again: I don’t believe you. He angled his face slightly downwards, the intensity in his eyes doubling. And I’m always here for you. Adonis just smiled, blushing slightly. Even though his night had been rough, even though he felt as though he deserved nothing in life, even though he was certain he was a disappointment to all, his self-loathing was placated by Sam’s determination to stay by his side. “Welcome to my pride and joy,” Odin said, throwing his arms wide and pacing backwards to face the prisoners and chaperones. “The library.” “I should think that a rather modest description, your grace,” Sam said with a smirk, attempting to bow. The guard yanked his hands, forcing him to straighten and cuffed the back of his head. “Hm,” was all Odin grunted, peering at them through his glasses. He turned away. The library spanned all the levels of the house except for the basement. Watery sunlight suffused the tall chamber, filtering through an arched glass dome that was similar to the one that capped the foyer. The sunbeams were splotchy today, broken up by the random patches of snow laying on top of the tempered glass. By the time the glow reached the bottom floor, it was reduced to dusky beams due to the despotic dark oak shelves that demanded precedence. The rich maroon carpets absorbed the rest of the leftover luminance. The shelves lined the walls all the way to the top as well, only broken up by the occasional inset ladder. Each ledge overflowed with ubiquitous books, the covers creating a cornucopia of muted pigments, all with varying widths and heights. Where each floor of the house should have been, alcoves were sporadically placed, each pocket having bone-colored hanging chairs and small stringed lights. Adonis gaped at the collection, aching to dig his bibliophile fingers into the pages and get lost amongst the inked words. He already recognized many of the selections at the bottom layer and he remembered the adventure each of the familiar titles had brought him in to. “Are these all yours?” Adonis inquired, his voice full of wonder and awe, briefly forgetting that he was being held captive by this man. “Your collection is vast.” Jeff’s cockiness faltered. “No actually, I don’t particularly enjoy reading, unless it is science papers. Most of these belong to my wife, Aspen-Fauna, who I believe you saw earlier,” he answered in a low tone, made slightly uncomfortable by Adonis’ interest. “Is the bottom layer all fiction? Are each of the levels sorted by genre? What are the other levels’ genres?” Adonis asked, a spark returning to his eyes as they darted around the room, unable to focus on just one thing. “I-uh…yes they are sorted by genre. The bottom is fiction, floor two is sci-fi and mysteries, third is history, and the top two are sort of random,” Jeff answered haltingly. He was focused on the floor and scratching the back of his neck. Adonis bounced on his feet slightly and grinned, enthralled by all the stories waiting to be read around him. Sam coughed. “Why did you bring us here? Just to flex your wealth?” “No, I have another purpose for you,” Odin lifted his head, returning to himself. “The agency is practically begging for an update from their beloved spies. Although I have emailed them multiple times saying it is going well, not to worry, they don’t seem to trust the word from their new hire. It’s been what, two, three weeks since they sent you? From now on, I’m going to have you call them three times a week to inform them of progress and keep them off my back.” “Ok, but why do we need to be in the library? I don’t understand,” Sam asked, still suspicious of Odin’s intentions. “I don’t need to explain myself to you,” Odin spat. “But I will. I picked the library simply because I think it is likely the quietest place in my manor.” And there’s nothing they could glean information from in here, he thought to himself. He clearly has some other purpose for this. And poor Adonis is gonna have all these books tempting him without being able to read them. “Your explanation for today is that I, Jefferson, have been a sitting duck in the forest, monitoring you and assisting you with tech. You both have been so busy with interrogating the other houses about my manor that you simply had no time and kept forgetting to update Selena, or whoever answers the phone. You still have a couple more houses to question, but so far, it seems as though there is no bomb threat and you do not need backup. You plan on getting into the targets’ manor, that is, my manor, within the next week or week-and-a-half,” Odin explained to them very slowly, talking down to them as though they were naive children. “What if we refuse to follow through with your plan?” Adonis asked, the new twinkle fading from his eyes. “What are you going to do, kill us?” “I wish I could. However, if you don’t follow through, you will be given a higher dose of the drug we gave you when you first entered my manor.” Odin smiled. His glasses’ lenses glinted a bright beam, completely obscuring his emerald eyes. “Yes, yes, judging by your faces I believe you remember how unpleasant it was the first time. Soreness, unexplainable weakness and swelling, am I correct? But this time, in addition to sore bones and weak muscles, the drug will be strong enough to make you also experience hallucinations, nausea and diarrhea for days.” Dread jolted through Adonis’ and Sam’s stomachs, widening their eyes and making their jaws go slack. Adonis had lost his father when he was thirteen due to an accidental morphine overdose, and had since been scared to take any kind of drug, medicinal or not. Sam hated being ill, and the mere thought of throwing up or having a fever terrified him. Their fears trapped them, and they meekly nodded, agreeing to go along with what Odin proposed. The guards, six in total, split into two and four. Two walked to a heavy desk and dragged twin rough-hewn chairs out. The other four each seized Sam and Adonis, one on each arm, and guided them to the chairs then forced them to sit. Adonis and Sam allowed themselves to follow with no resistance; Odin’s willingness to poison them still shocked them. The guards dispersed and lined the walls, standing about ten feet away from each other, creating a semi-circle wrapping around the room. Odin dialed the number on his phone. He put it on speaker. It rang three times. Selena answered. “Hello? Who is this?” Neither Sam nor Adonis spoke, as both were still detached from their surroundings. “Hello? Is anyone there?” Odin’s eyebrows pulled low on his eyes. He angrily gestured between Adonis and Sam. “Oh sorry! You cut out there for a second, haha,” Sam offered, forcing cheerfulness into his voice. Odin’s brows relaxed. “I also have Adonis here- “Hi!” Adonis chirped. “-and Jeff as well,” Sam finished, lifting his cool gaze to meet Odin’s fiery one. “Hello, Selena,” Odin said in a perfectly polished voice, neither friendly nor standoffish. Clean, oiled, his voice held no trace of guilt from the horrible threats he had just wagered. “Good! What kept you guys so long? What info do you have so far on the situation?” Selena quiered, relieved that she was finally hearing from her favorite team. Adonis looked askance, forcing out in the most convincing voice possible, “ah, sorry about that. We hoped Jeff’s emails would be enough to not worry you, but we have just been so busy up here we simply had no time to call you.” “So far, we’ve questioned lots of the other houses about the…the subject manor. It doesn’t seem like there is any real threat, but we’ve been very careful with our questioning so the master of the manor does not hear about us,” Sam said, still holding his stare with Odin, his voice coming out slightly choppy. “It doesn’t seem like a bomb threat, though. It seems more like-” Odin thrashed his hand through the air, warning Adonis to not say any more. “-more like just an overall weapons concern? I think the batty old guy has a huge stockpile.” “Oh, do you guys want any backup?” Selena asked, concern permeating her question. “N-no we’re fine. That’s just a guess. We don’t really know why there were reports of a bomb threat yet. But, uh, we’ll keep you informed on whether we’ll need backup,” Adonis rushed out, slightly panicked. “And from now on, we plan on calling three times a week or so. I think we are going to make a move on the manor in the next week. Hopefully, we will finish this up within the next four weeks, at most. I can’t see us needing to be up here any longer,” Sam finished, a convincing performance, except that his words came haltingly. “Sorry, love, we are going to have to go right now. There is a noise coming from outside our van, and I don’t want to draw any unnecessary attention to us,” Odin leaned over the table, hovering his finger over the ‘end call’ button. “Alright, I’ll let you guys go. You seem like you have this under control. Keep up the good work,” Selena said, and she hung up. Silence settled over the room, a thick and tangible silence, a blanket so heavy it sucked the air out of Adonis’ and Sam’s lungs. Odin pinched the bridge of his nose between his eyebrows. “You are an asshole, Sampson,” Odin hissed through clenched teeth, cracking the calmness. “What did I even do?” Sam asked, hiding a grin. He knew exactly what he had done. By saying that they would be back in four weeks and no later, Sam had clearly messed with whatever pre-set timeline Odin had thought of. He was forcing Odin to rush his plans, to work with four short weeks, unless Odin wanted a concerned agency wandering up into his domain.\n“Guards, take them back to their rooms,” Odin grumbled. Directing his attention back to the pair again, he said, “we will do this again in two days. This time, you had better follow the script more carefully, lest you want to suffer the consequences.” Odin swirled and stalked out of the room, two guards hot on his heels and the two closest to the doors struggling to open the doors before Odin reached them. He planned on seeking out the guard he had sent looking for a maid, and if he couldn’t find her, to look for Aspen. He stormed down the hall, his swift footsteps fading quickly. The leftover guards, stepped to the agents, jabbed their arms under Sam and Adonis’ armpits and harshly pulled them out of their chairs. They hobbled and tripped over their feet, hurrying to catch up with the guards’ eager pace. They traversed the hall again, the guards’ echoing boot sounds and soft slide of the agents’ wool socks being the only noise. Seconds before Adonis and Sam split to go into their rooms, they strained their necks to glimpse each other and share a mischievous smile. The guards noticed, and Sam’s guard yanked his cuffs again. Adonis’ guard grabbed his neck and forcefully pointed him forward. They each walked into their rooms, heard the locks snick behind them, then slipped off their handcuffs. In unison, they rubbed their wrists and each spotted a small package resting upon their televisions. Each grabbed the gift, unraveled the scratchy twine tying it together. A small metal rod rolled out and dropped into their palms. A small scrap of paper trailed after. The papers had a heart scrawled on them followed by ‘A-F.’ Adonis bounced the small stick in his palm and studied his note, which still had a small champagne-colored sequin sticking to it. Realization crossed Sam’s face and he walked to his door and slipped the metal into his doorknob. The knob clicked and the door swung slightly inwards. He gasped and shoved the door shut again, locking it hopefully before the posted guards noticed what he had discovered. Sam hid the small metal piece under dirt in his plant pot, next to the knife. Adonis tucked it between the folds of a hand towel on his bathroom counter.\nAdonis expanded over his bed, staring into his comforter and playing some cooking show on his television, wishing he could use his key to get out of his room. Even though the idea of sneaking out to meet Sam allured him, he logically knew that there was no way that he would be able to leave his room right now without the guards noticing. Maybe I could figure out when they rotate, slip into Sam’s room, and switch back when they rotate again, Adonis thought while yawning. His sleepiness was finally catching up on him. He tightened the furry blanket he had wrapped around himself, turning into a cocoon of warmth. A small shaft of sunlight turned the fine hairs on the blanket to a golden syrup. He curled himself into a tight ball and drifted off into peaceful rest, allowing his mind and body the necessary time to revive themselves. His dreams wandered, flitting from one setting to another with little notice. A lazy, comfortable smile rested on his face, staying until the last ten minutes before he woke up. His dreamscape was perpetually punctuated with loud steps and yelling. He slowly roused himself, at first believing he had imagined the sounds, but after he stretched out of his blanket-cocoon, he realized that the clanging and other ruckus was actually happening. He jolted over to his entryway, pressing his ear up against the doors, hoping he could overhear what the cause of the commotion was. I hope this isn’t because Odin found out about Aspen smuggling us lockpicks. She better be safe, Adonis wished fiercely. If the help that Adonis received came at Aspen’s expense, he did not want it. Next time I see her, I’m going to tell her to stop risking herself for us; we can handle ourselves. He stopped distracting himself with thoughts and resumed listening to the outside. In the distance, he thought he could make out Odin’s voice yelling “Where is she?” multiple times over. As he continued listening, he heard Odin’s voice getting closer and many jumbled footsteps following. A woman’s panicky voice joined the clatter and Adonis pressed his ear into the wood harder, straining to hear what she was saying. “Enough, Cassie! I don’t care what you have to do to find her, I need her back immediately!” the woman, presumably Cassie, was cut off. Adonis also thought he heard the smack of flesh colliding and wondered if Odin had slapped her. “Guards, open the prisoners’ doors right now! Make sure they aren’t holding her!” Adonis yanked his ear away and back-pedaled across his room, lunging for his fake handcuffs and fumbling to slip them over his wrists. He writhed on the floor, struggling to latch his hands together while holding them behind his back and hearing the posted guards fit the keys into the locks. The bolt slid out of place. This damn latch won’t hold! The door cracked open. Adonis accidentally pinched the skin on his wrist, drawing blood. Odin kicked open the door the same second Adonis flicked himself into a criss-cross sitting position. Adonis tucked his arms behind himself, hiding the fresh stripes drawn on them from his nails scrabbling to close his cuffs. Neither man said anything. Odin’s chest rose and fell quickly, and his face was a storm. Adonis steeled his eyes, challenging Odin’s glare while also trying to hide his own labored breathing. “Where is she,” Odin commanded in a deathly silent voice. “I haven’t the faintest,” Adonis responded cooly, cracking his neck while talking. “I know you know where she is! I know she wishes to talk with you!” Adonis froze for a millisecond, considering whether Odin really knew they had talked or if he was guessing and perhaps hoping to make Adonis flustered. He fell back into his rug and answered while staring at the ceiling, “I have no idea where ‘she’ is. I barely even know who you are asking about.” Odin huffed and turned out of the room, grabbing the edge of the door and slamming it behind him so hard the walls rattled. Adonis breathed out and relaxed when he heard the bolt click back into place. Through the thick door, he heard the same interaction happen between Sam and Odin, then silence reigned yet again when Odin decided to take his rage elsewhere. Adonis undid the clasp and chucked the handcuffs over to the door. I think, just in case, I should check whether Aspen left anything else in here that could frame me or her if Odin decided to do a room check. I mean, I doubt it. She’s pretty smart; surely she wouldn’t leave anything too big or obvious behind? Adonis pondered, but a heavy weight settled in his gut. Something foreboding pressed on him, weighing down his shoulders and filling his heart with dread. He clawed up from the floor, using the bedpost to stand. He then grabbed his sheets and flipped them back, checking nothing was stowed in his bedsheets. He looked under the pillows and bed, then inside and under all the potted plants. Okay, nothing here, just as I- he glanced at the floorboards right in front of the plant he was examining. A small, nondescript, black hair tie caught his eye. Oh no. That’s not mine. He bent to pick it up, then slipped it over his hand to wear as a bracelet. He stood still for a moment, staring at the hair tie; then panic took over. She might have left something else in here too if she left this! He lurched to the bathroom, one of the last big areas he had not yet searched. He shoved the shower curtain open: nothing. Underneath the toilet: nothing. Nothing inside the toilet paper holders, tucked inside a towel, resting in the sink, hanging around the back of the mirror. He pulled open the cabinet doors and rummaged through the bottles of chemicals. Nope, nope, nope nothing behind the glass cleaner, or the scented spray. He continued digging, reaching to the very back of the cabinet till his hand smacked the thin plywood back. He knocked into a tub of disinfecting wipes, and when he reached to right it, a small glint caught his attention. He grasped the source and pulled out the object. A pair of shining heels dropped into his lap. Nausea, triggered by his fear, rose in his throat. You have got to be joking. He carefully rose to his feet again and slowly ambled back to his main room. I think the only place left is my bureau. He let the heels slip from his fingers and clonk to the rug. He numbly pulled on the first drawer; nothing was in it besides the few shirts Francis gave him as well as the borrowed socks. But…but a pair of my socks are missing…. Adonis groaned and pushed the drawer shut again. He leaned his forehead on the edge of the dresser and pulled out the second drawer, which had three sweatshirts and two pairs of sweatpants. This time, there were only two sweatshirts and one pair of sweatpants. When he unfolded the sweatpants to double-check that there was only one pair, a lovely, shimmery, princess-esque tulle dress slipped out and floated to the rug, joining the matching heels. Adonis stood still in the center of the half-circle of incriminating objects before him. His head felt like it swam amongst the clouds, and he knew he should drink water or eat something, but he only lethargically turned about himself, staring with glazed eyes first at the simple rubber band encircling his wrist, then at the strappy, almond-colored shoes, then at the elaborate gown fanning across the plush rug. He snapped the rubber band to his wrist twice. How in the hell am I going to hide all of this? And what on earth kind of trouble are you getting into now, miss Aspen-Fauna?"

    "text": "I dashed through the halls confidently, pleased that my socks reduced my strides to bashful swipes. Whenever possible, I used the little-used servant’s shortcuts; most simply walked in the main halls, leaving the dusty, ramshackle passageways to themselves. Some sections of the ancient corridors were so dank the wood rotted away, and others had no windows, saturating the section in blackness. Out of the whole estate, the servant’s passages were the oldest and worst-kept parts of it, many of the areas having issues with pests and lots of the twisting passageways leading to dead-ends or crawl spaces. I ran lightly, bouncing on the balls of my feet, gliding over the jagged, splintered wood. I had most of the absurd map of the passages memorized, the result of Odin allowing me to explore the mansion by myself when I first arrived here. Left, right, veer to the left, down the stairs, flip 180, down another set of stairs, straight, and there it is, there being the washroom. The gaping entrance was weakly hidden by a towel bar on the other side. I brushed the towel to the side, checking for maids and squinting as the harsh lights blinded me. A single maid worked at the far end of the room, hanging synthetic-material clothes out to dry. She labored for minutes, hanging clothes, switching loads of laundry from the washing machines to the dryers, refilling the washing machines, folding clean clothes. Come on now, I thought, starting to become impatient. My forehead creased and my fingers twitched, knowing that every anxious minute wasted was one minute less than I had before my disappearance made it to Odin’s ears. When I thought I could not stand one more minute of watching her fold, hang and reorder the clothes, she finally stacked all the folded items into groups of shirts, socks, underwear and pants into a large hamper, balanced it on her waist, and departed. I breathed out, waiting a couple more seconds to make sure no one else came, then tore the towel aside and bounded to the back door. It was a simple door, painted white with a window set in the upper middle of it and a small shade blocking part of it. I crouched and looked side to side. I think there is a security camera on the wall next to this door. Even if I was seen on camera, I don’t think I would be recognized…but I still don’t want to take unnecessary risks… I leaned to my right and snatched a dirty sock lying on the floor. I painstakingly scooted the door on its hinges, centimeter-by-centimeter, waiting until the perfect moment that I could jump up and slip the sock over the lens, hopefully succeeding on the first try. The camera was an older one, and instead of having a circular three-hundred sixty view, it rotated on an old rusty support. I crouched and concentrated on it, counting how long each rotation took, learning the proper timing to jump. One…two…three! I exploded upwards, launching myself towards the camera and shoving the sock onto it as quickly as possible, then caught myself on the icy pavement, dragging my nails to slow my backwards slide. I shakily stood from my deep squat, adrenaline making my head light, grateful yet again that I did not have to wear a dress while doing this. I brushed a few flecks of ice off the sleeves of Adonis’ hoodie, glancing to make sure I had succeeded in fully covering the lens. A little crooked, but it’ll do…now where do I go from here? I don’t even know exactly what I’m looking for. I re-tucked my hair, fiddled with the hood, pulled on the drawstrings, fidgeting with myself. I breathed out, watching the air curl in white puffs and drift away. Shivers racked my chest and legs, but my feet were already numb to the coldness. I buried my hands into the long sleeves and then shoved them into the huge pocket on the front of the hoodie. Finally, I took one uncertain step away from the back door, one step closer to the secrecy and protection of the quixotic gardens. Snow gathered in random icy clumps and the concrete walkway was slick with thin, clear ice. Browned pine needles were trapped between the glassy sheen and the smooth concrete. In summer, the walkway was nice, just-warm underfoot, with dancing beams of sunlight and always a light breeze teasing your hair. In the winter, the once-lighthearted pines seemed foreboding, and the small bushes that flourished in spring and summer shriveled to dry husks. The only color was the green pine needles, but even their vibrancy failed to brighten the scenery. I followed the pathway with quick footsteps, fighting gravity and ice with each step and struggling to keep my balance. About thirty feet away from the house, the concrete started to gently curve up and to the right, and the paved walkway faded into a loamy trail. The trail here was protected under the dense canopy of pine branches, and though it was cooler with even less exposure to the sun, at least there were no snow patches or ice barring my progress. The trail snaked through the massive expanse of the back garden, having many turn-offs, forks, and places so small they looked only like thin game trails, all in an attempt to make the man-made area completely nature-bound. I yearned to continue wandering aimlessly through the woods, but my entire body shook and my cheeks were frozen, so I took the branches that led to the back of the forest the quickest. The forest grew on a slight incline, meaning if I climbed the hill and dropped to the other side, I would be completely out of sight of the house entirely. Plus, at the end of the forest, I had begun planting an organized flower farm about a year ago, with expansive rows of lavender, orange poppies, lilies, bluebells, droopy pink orchids, as well as many types of local wildflowers. I ordered the rows into a large circle, split into four main quarters, and at the very center is situated a marble fountain in the shape of a dragon unfurling its wings. The once-empty barren field had been transformed into a vibrant haven for gentle bumblebees and flitting butterflies. The only mar on the natural beauty was the slate-grey twisted-wire fence that boxed in the outer reaches. In the course of all of this, I had only been outside for ten minutes at most, but I already wanted to give into my screaming body and find somewhere warm to curl up. My lungs burned, my nose stung, my eyeballs ached for moisture. I wish I at least had boots. Or maybe a beanie. I trudged onwards, convincing myself that I was just imagining the pain. Every breath rattled my throat, hurting my lungs so much I wanted to cry. Thin trails of watery snot dripped from my nostrils to my lips, spreading in the crevice between my upper and lower lip. I craned my neck and a sob of relief escaped me as I saw bits of pastel-blue sky, meaning I must be near the crest of the hill where the trees’ branches become thinner. My thoughts came like sludge, lingering in my dull brain like honey. Just a…few more steps…then I’ll see my garden…and- a coughing fit suddenly overtook me, and I bent in half and stopped walking, waiting for it to finish. I resumed: -and whatever Odin has slapped back…here. The top loomed closer, twenty feet, seventeen feet, twelve feet, ten feet. I lifted my foot to step over a large knobbly root protruding from the ground, a root I had crossed a hundred times. I could not lift my toes high enough and I tripped, collapsing to the ground. Grunting, I heaved myself to my numb arms using my cold, dead fingers and tried to humor myself, thinking, well, at least I’m on the other side of it now. I hobbled the last few feet and at last looked over the field, my field. It dipped down slightly, creating the smallest bowl-shaped valley. I looked where I had planted my flowers, normally shriveled at this time of year and begging for warmer temperatures. I looked where my fountain was, standing proud, the dragon challenging every stroller on their promenades with his fiery stare. I looked where the circle formation was, split into four lovely sections, crunchy gravel pathways breaking up the clumps. And tears welled up in my eyes. My knees gave out; I crashed to the soft soil. Anguish ripped my heart in two. Pain. It was gone. It was all gone. Hours. Hours I had spent, laboring, pruning, digging, designing, planting. Gone. The grass was shriveled. Instead of hundreds of flowers, hundreds of small tents covered my land. Children teemed in them. They walked through the rows. They nodded to each other. They shivered with their inadequate winter clothes. They ate small meals from meager campfires and propane stoves. I grieved my lost work. I wanted to hate the children for destroying the one thing I had loved passionately, but I could not. They were not at fault here. Odin was. He always was. My love, my husband, my partner. My stealer of dreams, my wrecker, my enemy. Fury rose in my throat as I realized one last crucial detail. None of the children were laughing. Hundreds crowded the field; where were the games? The innocence? The laughter? My throat closed. My sobs, intensified from my rage, trickled away, draining. Hatred replaced it, firing my veins, growing my frustration. My mind cleared, the sluggishness power washed away by my animosity. I no longer felt the chill. I wished it was colder to freeze my anger. He is psychotic. Wicked. And I fell for his skullduggery. What does he even need these kids for? Why aren’t they safe with their families? I’m going to fix this. My heart raced as fast as my mind. I huffed, righting myself from lying on the dirt to kneeling. I am going to save these children, but I need to save myself first. I can’t keep gambling on half-assed plans. As much as I wanted to run down to the field and hug the children, assuring them that I was here to help, I knew that there were likely cameras planted here, monitoring them. For once, I need to put self-preservation before anyone else’s safety. I’m not the only factor in this dangerous equation; Adonis, Sam, the children, and all the houseworkers must dance in this pit of glass with me. I breathed deep once, twice, three times, crumpling my fists and screwing my eyes shut. Without opening my eyes, I slowly stood and arched my neck, splitting open my eyelids and gazing into the sky. A few wispy clouds were gusted by stiff winds, tearing apart and reshaping before my eyes, drifting lazily eastward. I reluctantly released my frustration of wanting to be a hero, but too scared of the consequences, into the heavens. The chill returned. I gasped as the cold air shocked my lungs again, seared my cheeks and nose. I finally admitted to myself that it was indeed very cold outside, and that no amount of will power was going to stop frostbite.\nI tramped away from the ridge, down the mountainside. I jumped over the knobbly root this time, using the height of the incline to my advantage and I cleared it easily, landing heavily on my stiff knees. Jamming my fingers into my armpits, I raced downhill as fast as I dared, hoping I might be able to slip into the house without being seen again. My anxiety returned as I saw the loam remerge with the pale, slick concrete. I freed my hands just to stuff back the loose strands of hair that had escaped during my journey, and slowed as the trees grew further apart, allowing that transformation of trail to pathway. I stopped completely for a minute, staying in the shadows, watching for any signs of movement. A single guard wandered close to the perimeter, bundled in large boots, a fur coat, a scarf and mittens. I hid behind a tree as he passed, jealous of his warm gear. Finally, I stepped up to the pavement’s beginning, and decided that the easiest and quickest way to get back would be to slide on my butt and hope that I did not spin out of control and run into one of the low walls following the path. Despite myself, I enjoyed the zip to the bottom, childishly wondering if I could come out here later and do it again. The slide deposited me right next to where I started, just a few feet from the laundry door. I grinned, feeling guilty for enjoying something, and hopped up, brushing as much dirt, ice chips and pine needles off of my sweatsuit as I could. For the first time, I really looked at the damage my adventure had done to the previously light-grey colored fabric. The socks had holes in the bottom, my pants were caked with mud and ice at the bottom, creeping all the way up to my knee, and my sweatshirt had streaks of dirt and a couple small drops of blood splattered on it from some unnoticed cut. Oh no, this is worse than I thought. I maybe could’ve gotten away with walking through the house before, but now there is no way I could possibly go through without getting attention. Stepping up the two stairs that raised the laundry room door slightly off the ground, I racked my brain for some kind of solution. Well, obviously this is a laundry room, so I could wash them, but I can’t just leave them running in the washer the whole time because I can’t stay, plus I would have to strip to nothing, and someone would probably walk in. Just before I pulled the handle open, the door pushed open and a helper walked out and into me. “Oh my goodness, ma’am, my apologies! I didn’t see you!” the man said, grabbing my arm so I would not slip from his bump. I struggled to find words, panicking that my ruse had been found out. “Wait a minute…aren’t you Miss Aspen? Well, you look like you’ve been in a bit of trouble, huh?” I still did not speak, trying to think of an excuse. The man saved me from answering by talking again: “I don’t think you wanted me to find you, am I right?” I nodded to that. “Don’t worry about that then. I’m Francis by the way, part time gardener and nurse.” He gently took my hand and led me inside, shutting the door behind him. “Oh dear, you look so frozen. Your lips are blue! How on earth did you end up like this?” he asked me, walking in a circle around me, lifting my arms. “I..I don’t really know how I got so dirty. I borrowed the clothes from one of the prisoners. Or, well, more of stole them, I suppose,” I trusted that since he would not tell anyone that I was outside, surely he deserved to know the truth of how I got myself into this tangle. “Odin hasn’t let me go into the backyard for some time, and I wanted to see my garden but…” “…but it’s not there anymore, am I right? I’m so sorry for your loss. I heard how much you loved those flowers,” Francis finished for me after I trailed off, leaning against a drying machine a couple feet away. “Yeah. Did you know about the children too?” Now Francis looked downtrodden. “Of course. My two kids are up there.” “I’m so sorry. I had no idea Odin had gotten this bad. I’m going to fix it right-” “Now, now, it’s ok! This isn’t your fault! There’s nothing you could have done, Aspen, and none of us blame you for this situation, so please don’t blame yourself,” Francis spoke softly and slowly, reassuring me. “Presently, I believe we should worry more about you, hm? I do think there is a large search ensuing for you, and I don’t think you want to be found in this state?” I nodded, grateful for this man’s kindness. How will I ever repay all the kindness debts I owe to people? “Ok, I don’t see any extra clothes lying around, but here-” he bent over and grabbed a towel straight from a washing machine, “- I’ll face the wall and you toss me your clothes and use this towel to cover yourself, alright?” He did as he said he would, and I quickly stripped and wrapped the towel around me, still slightly damp. “You know the servants’ passages, correct?” “Yes, sir.” “Good. Use those. Which prisoner did you get these from?” “I got them from Adonis. Thank you so much, Francis,” I smiled at him, the two simple words not conveying the depth of my gratitude. “Of course, Miss. Call me if you ever need help again, alright?” he said cheerily, throwing the soiled cloth in a machine and prepping to go back into the house, sliding off the clunky snow boots he wore. “Wait, weren’t you going to go outside?” “Ah, that can wait. Right now, I’m going to go inform someone that I believe I just saw Miss Fauna dashing to the second basement.” “You are a saint, Francis, truly,” I wished I could hug him, but it would be hard to do so without dashing what little modesty he had spared with the towel. “Now get out of here! Go hide somewhere!” I thanked him one more time, then whipped behind the hanging fabric concealing the tunnels, and dove into the darkness. This time, instead of going from Adonis’ room to the laundry room, I set my course from the laundry room to my bedroom. If I make it in time, I can probably just slip into the room with none the wiser. Oooh, and I think one of these branches leads straight into the back of Odin’s walk-in closet! I still sniffled from the cold, my arms and legs still ached with it, but I flew through the dark wooden shafts, ignoring the throbbing pain. In ten minutes, I had climbed all the stairs to the top and was near the exit to Odin’s closet. I slowed as I reached the opening, seeing thin bars of light, listening if there was anyone on the other side. It was completely still, so I guessed that Francis’ ruse had worked and that the party was searching through the basement, many floors below me. I dashed to my closet, threw on a cozy hoodie and fluffy socks that were my size, then puzzled how soon I could get Odin up here, hopefully minimizing the amount that his frustration could grow to. Oh, well, should be pretty easy. Just gotta walk in front of a security camera. I walked back through his closet and followed a path to just outside our room, removing a thin fake panel of wall that hid the passageway. I replaced it, then casually loped in front of the camera placed above our doorway. Odin believed it was a hidden camera, but I had known about it for years. Then, I sat at my computer, playing games, waiting for the devil to arrive on my doorstep."

Francis’ head swirled as he read the entire paper. Propaganda at its finest. He was disgusted. His eyes burned and throbbed. He wanted to scream and rip the papers into tiny shreds. \nBut he didn’t.\nHe started the car. Revved the engine along with the other drivers. Ignored his revulsion. \nHe hated Odin. He hated shoving such nonsense down his neighbors’, his friends’, throats. But who was he to play God and fight a self-pleasing dictator?\n↞⇼↠\nThe cars wended leisurely through Briarcliff, working from the front of the manor and turning south to the mouth of the valley. Ironically, Francis had to admit that Briarcliff was the perfect place for Odin to begin taking over whatever he was going to take over. Secluded, rarely heard of, and only having one main entrance into the town would be a massive advantage to him. \nEven under normal circumstances, food had to be delivered on big trucks to the area, and it was a tricky process as the grade of the mountain road was sometimes too steep for the deliveries. The trucks normally would drive to one of the two big food markets or some of the smaller gas stations to drop off their load, but recently the drivers had been instructed to park at the mouth and wait for the vans to drive up; the ruse being the road was too slick and dangerous with black ice for the haulers. Francis pulled up and parked his car behind the others, leaving room behind him for the rest of the caravan to park. He walked up to the truck driver leaning on the side of the hood, greeting him with a handshake. The driver stretched his arm back inside momentarily to put out his cigarette. The rest of the crew began unloading and transferring the food into the vans, putting stuff that did not require ice soon into Francis’ van so he would have enough time to deliver the posters. “Hey, man, what’s it like in the outside world?” Francis asked, relaxing on the closed door. “Nothing much,” the driver responded. He thought for a moment then said, “Actually, there’s this strange sickness called ‘corona’ that some scientists are freaked about.” “Oh? Corona? Like the beer?” Francis asked again, confused. “Yeah. Strange thing. It supposedly spreads really quickly, but it’s not in the U.S. yet. I think we’ll be ok. Y’know, modern medicine and all that; I can’t see it getting too bad. Plus you mountain folks are so secluded you probably won’t even hear about it or nothin’,” the driver said, nonchalantly flicking his hand. The driver made other small talk with him, about weather, about politics. They conversed for a while, as Francis did not feel inclined to help unload. If anyone complained about it, he could always just say his back was acting up again. Francis glanced back to see the progress of the other workers, noticing they were almost done reorganizing the food in the backs of the vans. “Well, hey man, thanks for bringing all this up. It’s been a real pleasure meeting you,” Francis smiled and clasped the driver’s shoulder. “And let us know if anything more happens with this ‘corona.’” “Of course. Y’all have a good day now,” the driver tipped his hat and hopped back into his high seat. The vans turned back down the road, heading back to the mansion for redistribution instructions. Francis waved them off, listening to the dwindling sound of the engines to go away completely before he got back into his own van. Though he started the engine, he did not drive off right away. Francis sat in the heat blasting from the vents and pulled out his old phone and searched up ‘corona.’ Millions of results came up, mostly of beer, but towards the bottom of the first page, multiple articles spoke about doctors’ concerns. COVID-19: fast moving, variations, only a few seconds needed for transmission? Symptoms include coughing, fever, headache, muscle aches… the symptoms went on and on. Hmmm…interesting. I don’t think Odin would like it if this somehow got into the house…\nHe put his phone back in his pocket and split off from the main road, veering into the heart of town. He retied his scarf and threw on another sweatshirt underneath his coat; the windchill was brutal today. He dragged himself to every door, slipping a piece of paper underneath the bottom edge. The sun crept from the eastern sky to the low western sky. And he still trudged from eave to eave. Eventually, all of the papers were gone, forced upon Briarcliff. Francis dropped heavily into his van’s chair for the last time that day. He buried his face into his ice-caked mittens. The ice froze his cheeks, but he did not even notice the pain. He wept. He wept for Coliban and Ambar."

    "text": "↞⇼↠\nNovember 25, 7:43 A.M.: it had been three days since the propaganda posters had been distributed. Adonis had not seen any of them personally, but he had heard snatches of information from the chatty guards and maids. Right now, he was twiddling his lockpick between his knuckles and straining to hear anything going on outside his doors, squinting his eyes tightly as if that could make him listen better. At approximately 7:45 every other morning, there was a small gap of time, twenty seconds on average, of a blindspot as the guards rotated. The guards standing at the door would walk out of the hall in unison to the right, and the new guards would stroll in from the left, and the curve of the walls would hide the view of Adonis’ and Sam’s doors momentarily. The guards seemingly rotated at random, but after being imprisoned for a few weeks, Adonis was beginning to notice a pattern. Today, the guards should rotate again at 1:15 in the afternoon.\nSam and Adonis needed to strategize today; Adonis thought the next meeting with Selena would be tomorrow, and they needed to think of what to do. He glanced at the clock on his bedside table again; eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two...now! A moment later than his countdown, the guards’ footsteps started. \nAdonis leapt up, shoved his lockpick in the door, flicked it until it caught, let himself out, yanked the door until it was centimeters away from the jamb, gently guided it the rest of the way closed, slid on his socks down to Sam’s room. On his now-left, the footsteps faded, and on his right, the new guards could be heard getting closer and closer. I hope Sam is awake by now, although Adonis knew Sam likely wasn’t. Adonis was not necessarily a morning person, rather an all-over person, as his anxiety messed up his sleeping schedule. Sam was a consistent sleeper, and he consistently tried to sleep past noon. The lock clicked open. Adonis jumped in, rotated back to the door, pulled and locked it, backing away, muffling his labored breathing with a blanket he snatched from Sam’s bed. The guards stepped into position, completely oblivious and unassuming. Adonis grinned evilly. I’m really surprised I pulled that off, to be completely honest. I kinda thought I was finally going to meet God. He put the lockpick on Sam’s bureau and crept to his bedside, wondering how to wake him up as quietly as possible. Sam typically was a violent wake-upper, meaning he sometimes would lash out physically or vocally if you surprised him awake. So, Adonis carefully reached his hand around Sam’s torso as he slept on his side, hovering it slightly off of him, then tightened his and pushed the blanket he held onto Sam’s face at the same time. Sam immediately jerked awake, his pupils wide, and tried to yell, but Adonis gripped him and shoved the blanket into his mouth. Sam blinked hard, slowly calming back down. Adonis released the blanket and held a finger to his lips while staring deep into Sam’s eyes. Removing his arm, Adonis tip-toed to the bathroom and beckoned for Sam to follow him. “Good morning,” Adonis formally greeted Sam. Sam dropped to the tile floor and leaned against the wall. “No. Bad morning. Too early,” Sam yawned widely. “What are you doing here?” “Well, I think Odin is going to have us meet with Selena again tomorrow? Am I right?” Sam nodded. “Then we need to strategize. I believe we have five-ish hours before the guards rotate again and I can leave, so until then we just need to talk quietly.” Sam thunked his head on the wall and closed his eyes. “Adonis, you didn’t think this through. What about the people who drop food off to us? What’re they gonna think when you’re not in your room, but here? How would we even say anything important to Selena with Jeff hovering right over us as well as feeding us a script?” “Admittedly, I did forget about the meals. But! I did think of a strategy for the call tomorrow,” Adonis started talking faster, getting excited to present his ideas to Sam that he had thought about all night. “I guess for the meals, I can just hide in here somewhere and you can greet the maid and tell them I’m sick or something so they won’t see me. Anyways; strategy. I think we can probably guess what Odin wants us to say. Something like, we’re doing well, everything is on time, we are closing in on the mansion, we’ve found a way in, we don’t need backup, everything seems fine. So, using that, we can think of words to say for that!” Sam clearly didn’t understand Adonis’ full idea: “Obviously we’re going to be speaking. What do you mean ‘we can think of words?’” Adonis leaned onto his knees and placed his hands in front of himself, balancing weight on his knuckles. “We can hide a code in our words. I propose something simple, such as every first letter of every word or something. Do you see what I mean now?” Sam jerked forward. His eyes widened. “Adonis, you’re a genius.” Adonis nodded enthusiastically. “Although, maybe not that code, because it can be cracked a little too easily.” Sam dashed from the bathroom and returned with a short, dull, nub of a pencil and a small pad of paper. He stated simply, “now we make our code.” They sat on the cold tiles for hours, only interrupted twice by the meal deliveries. Finally, minutes away from the guard’s rotation Adonis would use to leave, they came up with the perfect sequence.\n↞⇼↠\nNovember 26, 10:24 A.M.: The phone sat in the middle of the triangle. The triangle was wrapped in a half circle. The triangle’s points were Sam, Adonis and Jeff sitting across from each other in the library, Adonis and Sam tensely waiting for Odin to say something. The half circle was an entourage of guards zoning out while trying to look anywhere but Odin’s gaze. Odin leaned back in his chair, crossed his legs and tapped his lip with his right forefinger. “So,” Odin started. “You both know what to say. More importantly, you should both know what to not say.” Adonis and Sam nodded. On the outside, they were both coolly staring at Odin, calm. On the inside, they were nervously hoping they could get their whole message out without being interrupted. Odin slowly perused their faces, enjoying watching them squirm under his stare. He narrowed his eyes, uncrossed his legs, and dragged his phone in to himself. As he dialed Selena’s number, Adonis and Sam looked at each other sideways. Sam subtly nodded. The triangle all turned back to the phone as Odin replaced it in the middle. It only rang twice before she picked up. “Hello?” Selena asked. Odin flicked his fingers at them. Adonis obliged. “Hi Selena! The mission is going well. We will keep calling you two or three times a week.” Sam started his part: “Today, however, I see us interrogating suspects about the countless ordeals during everything we’ve done that we’ve heard of. We’ll ask them lots of stuff. Because, y’know, every other thing might be important.” “We will keep you posted on that as well. Maybe we should write our first letters to the agency. Some of our information could be too important to say over the phone,” Adonis finished. He was for once grateful that his hands were bound behind him so that Odin couldn’t see them shaking. “…wow! You boys certainly seem very productive,” Selena responded, slightly taken aback by their language. This is definitely planned. She brushed it off as they were likely rehearsing what they were going to say before they called so they could say it quickly. Service was spotty in the mountains, plus they probably had to be quiet to prevent discovery of their hideout. But I think it’s probably a good thing that it’s protocol for the agency to record calls. Odin wasn’t liking how structured their sentences were sounding either. He turned them over and over in his mind, but he couldn’t quite pin what was off about them, other than just sounding awkward and choppy. “Jefferson is there with you guys too, right?” Selena asked. The pair looked to Odin for guidance. Odin slashed his hand over his neck. Why shouldn’t he have to talk? Why should we have to do all the dancing around? Sam’s cockiness made him want to slap the smug look off of Odin’s stupid face. “N-no, he’s not here right now, he went down to-” Adonis improvised. “Actually, I think he just got back,” Sam cut in. He delighted in watching Odin squirm. Sam flicked his fingers at Odin, prompting him, fisting control from Odin and holding it in his own palms. Odin clenched his jaw and quietly said hello. Adonis sat in shock, wishing that Sam had not done that to himself. Sam smiled. It was the little victories that were going to carry him through this. All he had succeeded in doing was making Odin say hello, but it was enough to go against what he wanted, and that was enough to make Sam happy. Besides, Odin never specified before this call that he wasn’t going to talk. “Bye, Selena! We’ll talk with you soon!” Adonis ended the call. The phone clicked off, hanging up from the other side of the line. Adonis thunked his head on the table. Sam mirrored Odin’s stance, both relaxed in every way except for the cold war they fought with their eyes. Sam melded his fear into confidence. “Guards,” Odin called, only moving his mouth. “Take him to the basement. You can bring the short one back to his room.” “Ha! You think a basement is going to scare me? A little darkness is going to whip me into shape?” Adonis groaned inwardly. Sometimes, Sam really didn’t know when to shut up. “This darkness will. I don’t think you’ve seen the other basement, have you?” The guards closed in on Adonis and Sam, yanking them out of their chairs. “Goodbye Sam. I do wonder how your trip will be.”\n↞⇼↠\nThe agents were escorted out of the room. Odin stayed behind, thinking over the call yet again. Something is not right about this. They had no time to prepare before the call, right? I gave them no time, yet both their sentences were poorly constructed, a bunch of unintelligible words slapped together. There must be a code, but what was it? Odin struggled to remember each word they said, knowing it would be important to solving whatever they had hidden within their word tangle. If only I had the smarts to record the call. I will do that from now on.\nOdin didn’t know the code, but unknown to him as well, a small, square piece of paper tucked inside of an empty conditioner bottle, did. Hi Selena! The mission is going well. We will keep trying to tell you what is going on about two or three times a week. Today, However, I See us Interrogating Suspects about the Countless Ordeals During Everything we’ve heard of. We’ll ask them lots of stuff. Because, you know, every other thing might be important. We will keep you updated on that. Maybe we should write our FIRST LETTERS to the agency. Some of this could be too important to say over the phone. The sheet had tons of scribbles, underlining and rewrites all over it. Adonis and Sam had ended up straying slightly from their script, as they couldn’t have it right next to them, but it had the same meaning. The first few sentences were gibberish. The fourth, sixth, and eighth sentences were all important; the sixth and eighth were instructions: pay attention to every other sentence, look at the first letters of words. When going back to the fourth sentence, all the first letters spelled out were THISUISATCODEWHO. Ideally, Selena would eliminate some letters with a bit of guesswork and extract ‘THIS IS CODE.’\n↞⇼↠\n“What are you doing, Sampson?” Adonis raged as soon as the doors of the library closed behind them. “Now you’re the idiot not thinking things through!”\nSam knew Adonis’ angry words were coming from a deep place of care, but that didn’t make them sting any less. “Honestly, I thought he was bluffing. I didn’t think he would actually drug us when he needs us for communication with Selena!” Sam shot back.\n“I don’t think anyone here is too important to Odin for him to not punish!” The guards leading Sam and Adonis stayed silent as they lashed at each other. “We are in a game, Sam! A game where neither of us know the rules and no one will tell them to us! The only part of this that isn’t a game is if you die while playing, you will actually die! Don’t make such stupid decisions on your own! Use some integrity.”\nSam burned to yell back at Adonis, but he knew that Adonis was right. He was being a cocky idiot, throwing himself into the fire without caring how much the flames scarred him. \nAdonis noticed the guards starting to lead them in different directions. “I love you, Sam. Stay safe, bro.”\nSam’s throat swelled and he stared at a light to prevent tears from coming out. He had cried in front of Adonis before, but he wasn’t about to cry in front of these guards. “Love you too, Adonis. I promise I’ll be ok,” friends, the rarest kind. Platonic soulmates, bros, brothers from different mothers, whatever you called them; Sam and Adonis were inseparable for life.\nSam’s guard led him down stairs, and as they rounded the stairs to the bottom floor, the guard tentatively asked Sam, “Why did you do that? Surely you knew there would be consequences, so why take the risk?”\nSam thought for a moment, digging in himself to find the truest reason for his actions. “I guess a part of me thought he wouldn’t really make his threat true. Even though I can be quite pessimistic, I try to see the best in people. And sometimes I definitely don’t think things through, as much as I get annoyed at Adonis for it.” He thought for a moment more then added, “I find that I often put others before myself as well. It’s a bad habit, but I don’t have a lot of awareness of self-preservation.” The guard nodded, understanding that almost self-sabotaging behavior. Sam twisted his neck as far back as it could go to look at the guard. He asked, “Am I going to die from this?” After a long pause, the guard answered, “…no. But by the end, you might wish that you had. I certainly don’t envy your position.” “Well, if I won’t die, bring it on; I can handle it.” The guard smiled a weak sad smile, heavy with knowing, at Sam. The guard stopped in front of a stern-looking woman, and the young guard gently undid Sam’s cuffs and left them on a table, to be put back on when he re-emerged from the room. The guard tried to smile supportively at Sam again, then waved and walked out of the hall. Well, he was pleasant. I hope I meet him again in the future. “Good luck in there. Eat this,” the woman held out a pill. “No,” Sam defied simply. “Don’t worry, it’s a pain killer. Here, use this to wash it down,” she held out a tall glass. That much was true. Sam read the small numbers on the pill, and recognized it. He drank the water. Almost instantly after he drained the glass, he dropped it and collapsed to his knees, clutching his abdomen. It shattered into a thousand sparkling shards onto the pristine marble. The woman knelt next to him. “I-I’m sorry. It was in the water. I really hate this job, I’m so sorry.” She opened the door right behind him and gently pushed him all the way to the floor, then rolled him into the dark room. She winced as his screaming started, melting together with the others’ screams. She yanked the door shut and pressed her hand tightly to her lips.\n↞⇼↠\nNovember 26, 11:48 A.M.: Selena listened to the call again, for the third time. This doesn’t feel right. “Hey, Jimbo! C’mere!” Selena leaned back to peer around her cubicle and yelled at her girlfriend, Trinity, who worked in a different department just across the hall. “You know I hate that nickname,” Trinity mumbled into Selena’s ear as she stumbled in. Selena giggled and kissed her cheek as Trinity wrapped her arms around Selena’s neck. “What do you want?” “Can you listen to this recording I have with my agents? Something is off about it, but I just don’t know what yet,” Selena explained and handed Trinity an earbud. Selena waited patiently while Trinity listened. “You’re right,” Trinity said a couple minutes later, taking the earbud out and replacing it on Selena’s desk. “They’re for sure hiding something for you in there. Wanna go into the conference room and figure it out?” “You don’t have anything to do right now?” Selena wanted help, but she also didn’t need Trinity getting fired. “I do, but I’m procrastinating! Let’s go!” They went into the conference room with pens, sticky notes, and two cups of coffee, one basically creamer and the other black. Selena listened to the call as a whole, trying to understand the whole call. Trinity picked apart each sentence, each word, seeking the individual meanings in each line. Selena noticed the sixth sentence saying every other thing would be important. Selena and Trinity fought for a while, not sure whether that meant every other word was important or every other sentence or even every other message the agency received from them. Eventually they decided it meant sentence as Trinity noticed sentence eight saying the first letters were important. Tracing back to the fourth sentence, they solved the word puzzle. “All that work just to get THIS IS CODE? That’s stupid and a given; that’s why we were solving it!” Trinity complained. “No, no! It’s not dumb or a waste of time! Think about it.This is gonna be the same key they use for the next call. And the next call, and the next call. And we’re probably the only ones who have it, because how would you get it unless you relistened to the call multiple times?” “Something must have gone wrong then. Why else would they need to use a code?” “I don’t know. I think we should send in another team to help them,” Selena opened and closed her hands, nervously twitching her fingers. “No, that wouldn’t work,” Trinity countered. “What good would it do the agency if we got two teams stuck up there? If Adonis and Sam, two of our best agents, got captured, surely any other team would get caught too. Do you know if they’re going to call you again?” Selena jumped from her chair excitedly. “Yes! They said they were going to call about three times a week; that should give them plenty of time to tell me what’s really going on, and what I should do.” “What we should do. I’m invested in this now; I want to help you,” Trinity reached out and flicked the tip of Selena’s nose. Turning back to the table, Trinity reminded Selena, “Before you forget, write down the code. Losing that would kinda suck.” Selena scribbled on her notepad, then immediately ran back to her desk and slapped it on the top of her computer monitor so she wouldn’t lose it.\nThree times a week. Every other sentence. First letters."

    "text": "A small part of her wondered whether the next time he saw him it would be at his grave.\n↞⇼↠\nFirst a missing knife. A random sock frozen on a security camera. And now blood on your dress that I bought for you. Not to mention the clothes the prisoners somehow got.\nOdin stared at Aspen sideways, tenting his fingers around his temple to hold his head up. He  watched her mouth move, her eyes light up, the slight bouncing in her hair as she exuberantly told another story. He smiled, satisfied she was his bride. \nI love her. She loves me. That’s all I need to know. Yet he noticed again as she wrung her dress in between her slender fingers. The slightly too long pause she took between each sentence in her story. The way she was carefully covering up every bit of the silence. Those idiot guards must have paraded Sam throughout the halls. How else could she have managed to get blood on that dress? I’ll have to have a meeting with them. I do hope you didn’t see Mr. Sam. Although, I suppose you don’t even know who he is. If you did see him, I hope for your own sake you see it as a lesson, my dear. Odin mused. He moved his fingers to scratch his chin. I see all. I know everything that goes on in this house. I control what goes on here. I get to decide who to punish as I see fit. I decide people’s fate because I have the power. I’m finally at the top. I’ve finally accomplished something. Something worth recognition. Finally, I’ve outdone everyone else.\n↞⇼↠\nAdonis experienced a profound sense of deja vu as he stood in the exact same spot as he had a few days ago, pressing his ear to the thick wood door, to listen to the guard’s movements outside. The only difference was this time, he was wishing the guards would come faster and he was in Sam’s room. He had been listening to the guards for the past twenty-four hours, itching to hear anything about Sam. According to the conversation he overheard at about ten this morning, Sam was being moved back up to his room to ‘make room for more.’ Adonis hoped he had misheard the second part. Surely Odin wasn’t drugging so many people that his titanic basement was literally overflowing with the screaming dead, right? So Adonis had snuck into Sam’s room during the rotation, right after the lunch delivery time so he would not have to deal with the maid. He questioned if they would actually get dinner; the majority of the staff’s energy and resources was likely going to Odin and a very preppy dinner he was sure to have for Thanksgiving. The hallway echoed with loud clunking, quietly at first, then very loudly as the two guards bumbled around with Sam. Adonis stayed at the door until the last second he could, only dodging behind Sam’s bed when the keys were fit into the lock. The guards opened the doors, but instead of just staying at the door frame like Adonis thought they would, they actually came into the room. Internally groaning, Adonis crawled on his belly, squishing himself under the bed. The guards released Sam the second he was somewhat close to his bed, and with a great whuff his beaten, bloody, torso fell onto his pillowy comforter. His legs still hung off the edge. From his muffled hiding place, Adonis heard one guard laugh. Judging from the thin shadows he could see, the same guard also kicked the bottom of Sam’s foot. The other guard was silent. Adonis couldn’t see the second guard’s face, but guilt and pity played across it. They both turned and left. Adonis carefully flipped to his back and arched his neck to see above his head. He grasped a metal bar at the edge of the bed frame, then pulled himself out using only his arms. Standing very carefully, he crept around the room, closing the windows’ curtains, and moved the heavy dresser right in front of the door. He also grabbed the remote and turned the television to some random show, raising the volume to an unnecessary pitch. Anything to hide some of the louder noises we might make. Adonis finally turned his attention to Sam. He gently shook Sam’s shoulder, but Sam didn’t stir at all. Adonis scooped his arms under Sam’s armpits, lifted him off the bed, and dragged him into the bathroom. Moving him also let Adonis see Sam’s once-pristine comforter; the guard’s careless throwing of him had stained it with gore. Lowering Sam to the floor, Adonis tried to think of a way he could wash at least some of the blood off him without putting him at risk of drowning. Sam started mumbling something quietly. Adonis instantly kneeled next to him. “Can you say it again, Sam? I couldn’t hear what you said.” “The reason we got such nice rooms is-” Sam’s throat gave out. He cleared it and tried again. “-is to hide that damned basement.” His words slurred together. Adonis pulled away slightly and nodded. “Is it ok if I try to wash some blood off you?” Adonis asked, wanting to get Sam’s direct permission now that he was awake. Sam imperceptibly nodded, still not opening his eyes. He wet a washcloth and wiped Sam’s face, erasing most of the grime, but some had worked into his pores and stubbornly refused to wipe off. After dabbing Sam’s face, Adonis decided to move onto his main body. “Sam, can you lift your arms? And now your legs? One at a time is ok.” Sam listened to the instructions, but did not react beyond that. Adonis lifted off Sam’s sweatshirt and sweatpants, stripping him to his boxers. Adonis winced as he saw Sam’s body. Now that he had actually seen the damage in its entirety, he wished that he hadn’t. Cold seeped from the tiles into Sam’s direct skin, making him shiver violently. As Adonis leaned in to inspect all the injuries closer, checking to see if any were actively bleeding, Sam seized. Convulsions took over his body, wrenching his back and spine. Adonis bunched up the towel around Sam’s head but didn’t try to hold down Sam; he remembered from first-aid training that trying to do so could hurt him more. The best thing to do was just wait for the spasms to pass. The trickle of blood from Sam’s nose doubled to a steady stream. His convulsions finally stopped. I didn’t want to put him in the shower before because he would probably be cold after, but I don’t really think that matters anymore, Adonis grimly thought to himself. “Sam, this is probably going to hurt, but just try to relax. If it hurts too much, tap my arm.” As carefully as possible, Adonis hooked his arms around Sam’s armpits again and slowly pulled him into the tiny shower. He propped Sam against the wall opposite of the shower head and turned the water to a temperature he hoped was right. He watched with morbid fascination as filthy, brown-red water swirled off of Sam and down the drain. The shower was so small Adonis was balancing on his knees outside of the shower, leaning on his hand planted on the rim of the shower pan to reach inside and dab more dirt off Sam with the washcloth. The pure whiteness of the towel was soon soiled, blackened so much it was hard to believe it was ever white. Adonis attempted to shampoo Sam’s hair, but struggled so much he had to ask Sam to scrub it in and rinse it off. Showering was a long process, taking nearly forty minutes to get Sam slightly clean. Throughout the whole process, he grimaced, throwing his head back in pain when Adonis brushed against the more sensitive scrapes, but Sam was too stubborn to concede and tap Adonis’ arm. He still had blood crusted on him in places, but his need for sleep trumped his need for sterilization. A few drops of blood occasionally dripped out of Sam’s nostrils, but other than that, he was overall okay. Adonis rolled up two small strips of toilet paper and pushed one up each of Sam’s nostrils, then pulled him out of the shower to wrap him in the full-size towel. Heavily leaning on Adonis for support, they stumbled out of the bathroom together and made their way over to the bed. Adonis’ shoulders and arms almost caved from holding Sam up, so instead of actually helping him get onto the bed properly, Sam just flopped on it again. Adonis lifted his feet up and snatched the nasty comforter from beneath Sam. He bunched up the comforter and prepared to throw it across the room, but stayed his hand at the last second. He faced Sam again. In a low voice he asked, “Sam, do you think you have the energy to yell something right now? Something really short.” Sam slitted his eyes open and looked sideways at Adonis. “Do I look ready to yell something right now?” he answered with a question, his sarcastic air returning. “I think you’ll manage. All you gotta do is ask for Francis.” Sam kind of shrugged, the sheets getting in his way. “Alright then.” Adonis dropped the comforter, turned the television’s volume low and ducked under the bedframe. With all the strength he could muster, Sam called, “Guard! Can I ask a-” he coughed. “-a favor!” The guard unlocked the door and poked their head in. They looked annoyed. “What do you want?” “Can you please send in Francis?” Sam asked hoarsely. “He’s a nurse, and-” “Yeah, yeah. I know who Francis is. I’ll send a call for him.” “Thank you.” The guard paused halfway through closing the door. “…you’re welcome.”\nA few minutes had passed since the guard locked the door and radioed for Francis. “Adonis?” Sam asked. “Yeah?” “Are you going to crawl out from under my bed?” His throat ached when he talked, but he pushed away his discomfort to talk to Adonis. “Nah. I like it down here. Plus I can see the TV.” Adonis’ words were very muffled to Sam as they passed through his mattress. “You’re weird.” “It’s comfortable! Don’t hate on me just because you can’t move by yourself.” “If I could move by myself, I would move my hand to your face very quickly so I would hurt you tremendously.” Adonis just snickered in response. They watched the house show that was playing on the television, not understanding the point of it. Adonis thought it was stupid that this family of seven wanted to live in a house no bigger than seventy square feet and Sam couldn’t have agreed more. They had a pointless argument over the finer points of the parents’ obliviousness, pointless as they both agreed on how incredibly ignorant the parents must be. Adonis quickly shut his mouth as the room was opened to the hall again. The bars of light coming from the hall shifted on the floor as Francis stepped in. “Hello Sam! What can I do for ya?” Adonis popped his head out after Francis closed the door. “Hi!” Francis startled, dropping the oversized bag he had with him. He laughed and said, “Hello Adonis! Didn’t expect you here too!” Adonis smiled and wriggled the rest of the way out. He walked up to Francis and stooped to retrieve the bag for him. After he handed it back to Francis, he jumped on the other side of the bed and sat cross-legged on the sheets. “Now, why was I summoned by you rascals?” Francis asked, planting his hands firmly on his hips. “I didn’t know what to do,” Adonis answered. “There’s a bloody comforter, the rug is bloody, there’s blood on the floor, there’s blood on Sam. And his nose won’t stop bleeding.” “Are you sure you have any blood left in you, Sam?” Francis tapped his forehead. Sam smiled weakly. “How are you feeling?” “I thought I had died a couple of weeks ago when I was shocked;” Sam held up his finger to show the small scar. “But I’ve revised my view of death, and have decided that now I am dead. My stomach hurts, I’m nauseous, my head is floating around somewhere in the sky and my skin and all of these cuts throb in unison.” “When was the last time you ate or drank anything?” Sam struggled to remember. “I…I think the last time I ate was the morning of the twenty-sixth. Probably the last time I had water too.” “First off, you’re dehydrated,” Francis walked away and opened the door. He leaned out and said, “Hey boneheads! Do you even feed your prisoners? Yes? Are you sure? Go get food now!” After a pause he continued his tirade: “I don’t care if it’s Thanksgiving! Just grab something from the kitchen that looks edible!” He turned around and slammed the door. “Sorry, I hate dealing with idiots.” Sam and Adonis hooted with laughter. Sam laughed so hard he started coughing and Adonis had to double over to stop wheezing. “I do think your dinner will be here promptly, Sam,” Francis continued as if nothing had happened at all. Only a small quirk in his lips gave away the hilarity bubbling inside him. “For now, drink this and take this pill.” Sam’s hand shook as he accepted the cup. He trusted Francis, but he just couldn’t shake his last encounter with ‘water.’ Adonis noticed his fear and asked how the drug was given to him. Sam told him. “Sam, I’m so sorry that happened to you. But you can’t hold fear of drinking; you need to survive. It’s ok, there’s nothing in this water. Francis and I are right here,” Adonis said slowly, staring at Sam’s eyes. Sam nodded and took the pill.\n↞⇼↠\nFrancis had bustled about the room for the better part of two hours, chatting with Sam and Adonis, caring for Sam’s scratches and endlessly bleeding nose (which he finally staunched with a localized blood-thickening solution), and making sure Sam drank more water and ate the sub-par food the guard managed to collect. The sun sank lower and lower in the sky, turning into a bloated disk on the horizon with scratches of clouds hovering in front of it. After it hid behind the mountains and stained the sky with crimson and violet, Francis excused himself to go eat his own dinner. He took the rug and comforter with him. He had also scrubbed away the few drops of blood on the floor. Sam and Adonis sat in content silence, too weary to talk. Sam was circling in his thoughts, spiraling, and decided he needed to break the quiet. “I miss my family.” Sam had a large family, all who he left behind in Guatemala to pursue his career in America. He still visited them often, but a lot of the time, his meetings were cut short due to work. He missed his childhood home, a little village called Chichicastenango high in the mountains. It hurt him more when he remembered today was a Thursday; every Thursday and Sunday, there were big markets where you could stroll down the main road and buy all kinds of handicrafts, food and flowers. He was the oldest in his family, with five younger siblings, though technically he was the second oldest. He had an older sister until he was four, but she passed away due to a fever. Part of the reason for his hot-headedness was his burning desire to be an overprotective older brother. A gaping pit with spikes at the bottom threatened to swallow him if he kept going down the path of nostalgia; allowing oneself to stay in the past for too long can prevent future growth and destroy what is already in place in the present. “Why are you thinking of them?” Adonis asked while observing the cloth canopy draped between the bedposts, picking out every curve and flaw. When Sam didn’t answer, he followed up, “Is it Francis?” Adonis saw Sam nod at the edge of his vision. “Yeah, he reminds me of my dad too.” They didn’t say anything else. Stars flashed over the manor, the same stars that half the world could see at the moment. All over the world, families, friends, strangers gathered together for meals, Americans for Thanksgiving, everywhere else just for a casual lunch or dinner or breakfast. All the people in the world had two things in common: sharing food and sharing stars. Odin was an exception. He didn’t share, he just took and took and took. Sam and Adonis were also exceptions; while they did share the stars, they replaced sharing food with simply sharing each others’ presence.\nAdonis finally crawled back into his room at around one in the morning. He wanted to stay with Sam until he fell asleep, and he figured the meal deliverer wouldn’t care enough to check if he was actually there. On his way out of Sam’s room, he snagged the pen and pad of paper they used to make the code last time and scribbled a quick note to Sam. It said: Continue acting like you are horribly sick tomorrow. Try to not come to the call. He folded the scrap into a small free-standing triangle and placed it on Sam’s night stand, next to Sam’s glass of water. Adonis then returned to his room and sitting on his bed, he flicked his bedside lamp on and started working on the next call’s code."

The sun slid from a distant high point in the sky to a low pinprick hidden behind fields of looming anvil clouds. The clouds reflected on the dimpled lake, a strange half-world, matching the real life with an inverted and wavering version. The civilized part of the valley hummed with life and potential; but the natural landscape around it seemed devoid of color. Everything was in flat, grey-tinted colors with no definition. The sky was menacing and the trees foreboding. \nAdonis bounced his lockpick in his hand, the repeating slap of the metal piece smacking his palm the only sound in his room as he paced quick circles around it. His eyes glinted with every bounce of the key, the shiny metal reflecting brief flashes onto their glassy surfaces. Pausing his pacing for a second, he glanced out the window to observe the sun’s low hiding spot. It had only just passed three P.M., but the sun was already fixing to set. The clouds were a threat too. He hoped there would not be another storm coming, but knew it was feeble hope. Another storm like the storms I made up in the call. I’m surprised Odin let me get away with my lies, but he probably doesn’t care much what I say to Selena. It’s all lies anyway. He had heard Francis go into Sam’s room a long time ago, but the guards hadn’t given him an opportunity to sneak over yet. He was growing impatient and worried that Francis would end up leaving before he even got to see him. We have to strategize today! We can’t stay here much longer; firstly, Odin is getting way too suspicious, and secondly, I’m going to die of boredom. I’m so sick of doing the same things every day. He abandoned pacing to lean on the edge of his dresser and anxiously tap it with his fingernails. Spaced out at the floor and lost in his thoughts, he jumped when he heard his door unlocked and only had enough time to slip his lockpick in the waistband of his pants; he would hide it better later. “Hey, prisoner, this man wants you to go to Sam’s room,” the guard nonchalantly called in, barely cracking the door. The guard’s hesitation in opening the door fully allowed plenty of time for Adonis to slip his handcuffs back on, a result he was pleased with. Adonis didn’t know if the guards actually knew about the fake handcuffs, but it couldn’t hurt to keep the ruse going for as long as possible. “Wow, it’s impressive how you don’t know my name or the name of the guy trying to take me out of my room,” Adonis toyed with the guard, smiling. “Shut up. You’re a prisoner; that’s what your name is because that’s all you’ll ever be,” the guard wrenched the door fully open and glared at Adonis. Though Adonis was young, only twenty-three, the guard was still years younger. Adonis almost felt remorseful, as he knew the guard was likely in the same forced position as him, but he couldn’t push aside his hatred for his captors completely. “Can I get him now? Please, sir, it’s urgent,” Adonis restrained a big dopey grin as he recognized that voice as Francis’. The guard grunted, but stepped aside and allowed him inside. Francis spoke in a level, professional voice, “You. Come on, your friend keeps asking for you. He’s very sick, you know.” Adonis nodded and hung his head. Francis walked over and pulled Adonis up with his shirt and dragged him out. Adonis had to keep his eyes trained on the floor to compress the giggle building inside of him; he knew that if he looked at one of the guards’ unsuspecting faces right now he would laugh. “I don’t want any shenanigans. Sam’s door is going to stay open for the whole time-” Francis exhaled loudly and stopped right at Sam’s threshold. He dramatically rolled his eyes, carelessly tossed Adonis into the room where he tripped and sprawled onto the rug, and turned back to the guard. “I think the door will stay closed the whole time, sir.” “N-no I don’t think we’re even supposed to let Ado-the prisoners see each other s-so this is special and I don’t want to get in trouble, so it has to stay open,” the guard’s true youth finally showed as he stumbled over his explanation. “Sam is very sick. He needs Adonis because they have known each other for a long time, and he is the only familiar face in this damned hell-hole,” Sam coughed loudly to punctuate Francis’ sentence. “The door is going to stay closed unless you want to see and smell body sores and vomit and quite possibly diarrhea. I will take full blame if Odin finds out,” Francis said with finality. He pulled the doorknob from the flustered guard and shut the door by himself. Stepping away, he turned and dusted imaginary filth from his palms, squinting his eyes and turning up his face. Sam snorted and Adonis cackled into the plush rug. Francis knelt next to Adonis and unclasped his cuffs for him, asking why he was summoned to Sam’s room again. Sam reached for the remote and turned the television’s volume up unreasonably high. “We need to get out of here. Now.” Adonis’ simple statements took both Sam and Francis by surprise. Sam had known that their long-term plan was to get out sometime before Christmas, he just hadn’t known that it would be so soon. Francis simply thought that any and all escape from the manor was practically impossible. Adonis spilled his basic plan he had been constructing while Sam had been in the basement. The first part required as much outside knowledge as he could get; the only outside source he knew was Francis. Francis told him everything he thought could be important as quickly as he could; about the village’s children being captured and brainwashed; about the propaganda; the food deliveries, the guard rotations he knew about, the staff’s names who might be sympathetic, the servant’s passageways, social media monitoring, hidden cameras, broken and working golf carts, storm drain locations, where the garden shed was, even the strange sickness, corona, the trucker had warned him about. Adonis knew three things; one, they needed a clear way out of the mansion, two, they needed a nearby and hidden place to live after they got out of the mansion, three, they needed to plan their way into the future. First: out of the mansion. Adonis asked more specifics about the servant’s passages, corona, the storm drains, and the garden shed. Second: where they would go after they got out of the mansion. Adonis, and Sam joined in too, querying about the food deliveries, corona, and monitoring. They also asked about Francis’ house. Third: informing Selena. They would need one more call, meaning one more code. Adonis realized he forgot the pad of paper and pen in the other room, so Francis harassed the poor guard about needing to write down all of the serious medical conditions Sam was having at the moment until the guard produced a small notebook and a stub of a pencil. After two and a half hours of rushed planning, they had a hasty plan that relied mostly on Odin not finding out anything until the eighth of December, still days away. On the fifth, Francis was going to call in sick. He was going to need two weeks off, since the national doctors advised that two weeks of self-isolation was needed for this new virus. All of the English news stations were blocked by Odin, but a couple of the Spanish news stations made it through the firewall; Sam and Francis worked together to get snatches of information about the virus from the news. On the sixth or seventh, Sam and Adonis expected another call. They would give their final message to Selena then. On the eighth, at exactly eleven thirty-seven P.M., Sam and Adonis would let themselves out of their rooms and sprint down the hall to the closest entry to the servant’s passages, carrying backpacks Francis would smuggle to them. The backpacks were going to be stuffed full of the clothes they had been provided, as well as a towel, the small toiletries and anything else they thought could be useful. They had timed it so the guards shouldn’t see them leaving, but at that point, it wouldn’t matter. Adonis and Sam were going to memorize the servants’ passages from a map that Francis sketched, and the guards wouldn’t be able to follow them as the majority of them didn’t even know of the passages’ existence. They were going to follow the passages in a somewhat-circuitous route to the bottom of the manor and get out using the laundry room. From the laundry room, they were going to dash to the garden shed and pause momentarily to make sure no one was following them, or if they were being followed, the prosecutors were not directly behind them. One of the storm drains on the property was behind the garden shed, about ten feet into the forest and covered in a tangled knot of overgrown weeds and grass. This was the easiest part of the plan; all they had to do from that point was get in the storm drain and follow the grid pattern into the center of town, where they would turn left, right, straight, left and climb out again. The drains followed the streets’ patterns above them, and those were the directions Francis had memorized to his house. They were going to stay at Francis’ house. His wife would be there because she was allowed to keep her job as cashier at a clothing store, so she stayed in the house. His children would not be there. As soon as he got home on the fifth, he was going to carefully check his house, street, and houses around him for cameras, microphones, or any possible thing Odin could be using to track people. He couldn’t destroy the cameras as the head of security would get suspicious, but Sam taught him how to loop videos, occasionally throwing in new videos for variety. They would stay at Francis’ house until the nineteenth at the latest, as that was exactly two weeks away from the fifth. However, they hoped that they would be able to be finished with their master idea long before the nineteenth. Their call with Selena tied majorly into the third part. The call would be long because they needed to fit in two major things: they were leaving the manor on the eighth and likely would not have any more contact after that, and that they needed a ton of backup sent in discreetly on December eleventh. Their plan wasn’t solid, but any and all help, from any department, was going to be needed on the eleventh. Adonis felt his anxiety rising from what they were going to do; he was overwhelmed, it had been his idea, but it was so much more than he thought it was going to be, there was not enough time for it all, Odin was going to kill them, his throat was closing up already- Both Francis and Sam reached for one of his arms. They breathed deeply together. Adonis calmed and explained the code he and Sam had been using. So, at the end of their two and a half hours, they worked on yet another calling code.\nUnfortunately, they never noticed the small crack in the doorway. The small crack that the flustered guard was listening very carefully through."

    "text": "↞⇼↠\nDecember 6, 11:10 A.M.: Sam’s room echoed dully with throbbing reverberations as his door was pounded. He was jolted out of sleep and he leapt from his bed, punching the air as he landed on his feet. His heart pounded and realized there was no immediate danger as he blinked away the haze on his eyes. “Get up, you lazy pig!” Odin yelled from outside. The pounding on his door finally stopped when the guard opened the door. “Where are your handcuffs?” Sam grunted. “I don’t know. Where’s your courage? You need to cuff a man who’s still sick?” Odin marched over and grabbed Sam. Despite the height advantage Sam had on him, his body was still weak from the infernal basement ordeal and he nearly fell as Odin yanked him forward. “Guards, cuff him. Make sure they’re tight.” He looked up to Sam’s pale face and glared at him. Sam’s own ire rose as he saw how glowing, healthy, alive Odin’s face looked; he looked like he slept ten hours a night and ate fantastic meals and exercised regularly. Odin was completely unfazed by the torture he dished out. “Very tight.” Adonis came out of his room moments later after Odin personally woke him as well. He was prepared and already was wearing the cuffs that Odin didn’t know were fake. Sam winced as the guard dug the metal into the soft skin of his wrist and drew blood. Sam and Adonis’ faces were both ringed with exhaustion. They had made a copy of the code for this call as it was an extra long one, and they had both stayed up the whole night, as well as the last few nights, memorizing the words. Their scripts now burned in the forefront of their minds. Adonis noticed Odin eyeing the black band that was still around his wrist. He asked the guard if he could be uncuffed for one moment so he could put his hair up; it was so long he could barely see where he was walking. Odin dipped his head when the guard looked at him for instruction, and Adonis was uncuffed briefly to gather up his rich chestnut-brown locks and tie them in a small ponytail at the crown of his head. “You look stupid,” Odin said as they entered the library. “You look cute,” Sam countered. Adonis grinned. Odin looked severely at both of them as they got comfortable in the padded chairs. The pair were both getting excited as their departure date was quickly approaching and Odin had no clue about it. Adonis even bounced in his seat a little. “You both know how to do this. You both know the consequences.” Odin placed his elbows on the table and leaned across towards them. “I know you guys are doing something with these calls. Do not make me send you to the basement.” Sam and Adonis let the threat sink in for a moment. They let Odin think he had the upper hand. Then Sam said, in an almost tauntingly child-like voice, “Hey Jeff, I’m bleeding all over your chair from my cuffs.” Adonis snorted loudly. “The guard clipped my wrist.” Odin pushed off the table. “Like I care. The fabric’s red for a reason.” He dialed Selena’s number yet again and thrust the phone into the middle. He was going to allow them their little game, for now. He was determined to figure out their code tonight, so he needed the call to go how they wanted so he could get their raw wording without any quick changes or pivots. Besides, the cameras are going to be installed tomorrow. New cameras in front of their doors, and maybe a few more in the halls wouldn’t hurt. They aren’t going to be able to sneak around me ever again. “Hello?” “¡Hola Selena!” Sam started. “Hey Sam! Feeling better?” “Yes, much better, thank you. The investigation looks exactly as veritably interesting as it’s not good. There are lots of complications up here.” “Definitely, but the encore continues!” Adonis chimed in. “I feel as though we’re in a very interesting television show’s seasons at this point, with all the trouble we’ve received from the weather. As the agency always says, the weeks end on the eighth day!” “Yes, we are still making lots of progress. Nevertheless, ogling at one’s continued onslaught never thanks a caring thought. We have to focus on the positives to stay motivated! Besides, always counting kindness cheers me up!” “It is rather boring up here, actually, with us always continuing to be doing the same pastimes. Decidedly more exciting citizens here, though. They always have stories to tell. Even on the eleventh street, where practically no one lives, there’s stories. Overally, no new news. Just the same, slowly moving forward with the investigation of interesting townspeople. Keeping the entire investigation on the down-low as possible.” “Yes, that is everything! Sadly, we have to go again. Bye, Selena!” Sam finished, glossing over the call. “Thank you boys! Talk to you soon!” The call went faster than Adonis and Sam expected. They had anticipated that Odin would start to catch onto their code by now, especially after Adonis saw him record the last call. So, the code was made much harder this time. They still followed the basic pattern, every other sentence was important and the first letters of words were important, but they had also thrown in many unnecessary sentences that sounded like code but were gibberish. Plus, the sentences with code also had more unnecessary words, but it couldn’t be avoided unless their goal was to make an obvious word-salad. Even with the key they gave Selena, it was going to be a difficult one to solve due to the multiple false leads.\n↞⇼↠\nDecember 6, 12:56 P.M.: Sam sat on his floor with the serrated knife propped straight up with his feet. He clenched the knife as hard as he could to stop it from wiggling, but it still was difficult to work with. He had spent that last twenty minutes sawing at the chain connecting his hands. Even sitting in this position had been tricky. He had to bring his hands as low to the ground as he could and step his legs through the hole his arms made. Eventually, the thin chain gave out and his hands were free. Since these were the real cuffs, he had no way to get the annoying metal bands off, but he could at least move things around now. He wrapped the sharp edge of the knife in many layers of toilet tissue and put it in his duffel bag.\n↞⇼↠\nDecember 7, 4:38 A.M.: Odin screamed. He threw the steak knife he had used to eat dinner earlier at the wall, sticking it perfectly into the dark far walls of his office. A growl exploded out of his throat, viciously animalistic. His guards in the hall edged away from his doors carefully. He swilled the last of the red wine left in the large green-glass bottle. The dye in the alcohol matched the pigment of his bloodshot jade eyes. He briskly ran his hands through his light-blonde hair many times. Despite the high content of alcohol in his blood, his head was completely clear. He practically had Adonis’ and Sam’s words perfectly memorized; their voices droned in his head multiple times over, overlapping and crashing into each other. He stood up and paced around his office, his determination refusing to fade. It’s every three sentences that are important. He compared this call to the last and had noticed that pattern. Or is it every other sentence? And is it every other word? With every other word, he had gotten ‘there lots complications here’ from the first sentence. He tried letters and got ‘tileaviaing’ from the first sentence. Tile? He eliminated a few letters and got ‘leaving,’ but he couldn’t find what word came after that, and he couldn’t tell if it was actually part of the intended code.\nTrinity and Selena had strained over the call hours ago and solved it with much more success with Odin. They did struggle with the unnecessary words and sentences, but with the call they got: tileaviaing dbtec noaocontact backcmup dmecht leaving dec. no contact back up dec. They missed a few dates in the middle, which Trinity pointed out. She asked Selena what kind of saying was ‘the week ends on the eighth;’ it made no sense. From there, they looked at the in between sentences again and finally got: leaving Dec. 8. No contact. Back-up Dec. 11, down-low. “I wonder what their big plan is here,” Selena mused. “I don’t know, but somehow we’re going to need to get back up, and a lot of it, discreetly into the mountains in four days. The valley has only one entrance, right?” “Unfortunately, yes,” Selena responded to Trinity. “But if they can make an entire secret code, I think we can send them some back up.”\n↞⇼↠\nDecember 7, 1:32 P.M.: Sam pressed his ear to the thick wood, trying to make sense of what the guard and someone else was whispering on the other side of his door. Their voices were so low he eventually had to give up listening through the door to lay on the floor and try to listen through the crack. Although it was still quiet, Sam started to pick out a couple words. “….above their rooms. Odin’s orders.” “Why? There’s always someone on guard.” “He’s paranoid, that’s why. He thinks the agents are somehow conspiring behind his back, even with all you on guard.” “He’s crazy.” “I know. Also, the prisoners aren’t supposed to know about these, so make sure they don’t see them.” “What if they do see them? What should I say if they ask?” “Just say…” the person’s voice dipped and Sam couldn’t understand what they were saying for a second. “…but don’t say that they’re any kind of monitoring device.” “Obviously. We want to catch them on tape if they really are sneaking around.” Sam smirked. Idiots. These doors are thick, but apparently not as thick as your skulls are. Even if the cameras have night vision and see us leaving, it’s not gonna matter. We’re leaving tomorrow night; after that we should be out of Odin’s grasp. Sam stood up and backed away as the sound of drilling whined in his ears through the crack. For wanting the camera’s installation to be a secret, Odin did not train his servants enough on how to be silent. Sam sauntered to his window and wiped the condensation from it with his sweatshirt sleeve. The heavy thunder clouds from a few days ago were still clinging to the air above the lake. They looked all too threatening to Sam, but they still hadn’t released their rain or snow or whatever they held in their columnal penetralia. Basically, the rain gutter was no longer sound proofed by snow. It had patches of slick, clear ice, but they were so sporadic they shouldn’t affect sound transmission. Sam broke the ice shell rimming his window panes and swung it outwards. He leaned out and down to the gutter and started tapping on it ‘A’ until he got a response from Adonis. WHAT? Adonis asked. SECRET CAMERAS OH I DON’T THINK WE SHOULD WORRY Sam tapped even faster, trying to convey all his thoughts concisely. IF THE CAMERAS SEE US IT WON’T MATTER TRUE They tapped goodbye but didn’t communicate anything else. Their fingertips had turned uncomfortably cold and tinged with blue.\n↞⇼↠\nDecember 8, 12:15 P.M.: Odin glared darkly at his desk. He was spread out over his large office chair. Technically my grandfather’s chair, he reminded himself. His legs melted off the chair into the floor. His left arm was neatly resting upon its armrest and his right arm was draped halfway off, the sculpted neck of another wine bottle precariously dangling from his thumb and middle finger. His eyes were a firestorm, swirling with unbridled power, billowing dangerously with black soot clouds and fiery sparks emanating from their core. His head throbbed slightly from the constant drinking he had been partaking in for the past two days. He lifted the bottle to swig from it again.\nThe heavy oak table thudded as he slammed the near-empty glass bottle on it. He straightened his oatmeal sweater and long grey trench coat and stood, leaning heavily on his desk as nausea rose in his throat. He shoved it away; he had a good history of holding his alcohol, and he wasn’t going to allow himself to ruin it now. Where’s Aspen. Where is that- he remembered how Adonis had reacted when he asked where Aspen was just days ago. -that cheater. I need to find her. My little butterfly seems to have flitted away from me again. “Guards! Find Aspen! Now!” Odin yelled from inside his room. He stumbled to the doors and barged out. A slash of sun, beaming cheerily through one of the many windows of the foyer atrium, burned into his eyes and lanced through his brain. The guards nodded to him, one guard halfway-offering a steadying hand to Odin. “I don’t need either of you. Where is Aspen?” “She is in her garden, sir.” Odin trudged down the hall, stopping when he wobbled once. He breathed deep into his lungs and fell against the wall near him. He breathed out through his nostrils, clenching his eyes, steeling himself. When he bounced off the wall and reopened his eyes, he no longer felt any effects from the alcohol. He found Aspen watering her azaleas towards the left-back of the foyer. He was in no mood to admire the sunlight playing with her hair, the flashes of white dancing on her from the quietly trickling koi pool. “Put down the watering can,” Odin commanded. Aspen’s back went rigid, and her mind dared her to keep tending her plants, but she listened to him. “Let’s walk.” She laid her left arm atop his proffered right arm. As they strolled through the house’s halls, Aspen asked, “To what do I owe this pleasure?” Jeff didn’t answer. She resolved to not speak until he did. “We haven’t talked in a long time. What have you been up to today, this week in general? Even the past few weeks?” Odin finally asked. “Lots of my flowers are blooming. My winter flowers, that is. My summer ones are looking dreary. Oh, and I built a new house in that mining game; you should look at it. I did it on your PC.” Jeff smiled a little as she talked about her in-game house. She told him about how it was a big castle built with cut stone bricks and her favorite dark wood in the game. She told him how she grew berries and trees, and farmed flowers and bees. “Your castle sounds lovely. I’ll have to look at it later,” Jeff looked down at her. But even half-sloshed, Odin’s mind was impressively unfettered. “Have any of your adventures needed a kitchen knife? The kitchen staff claims they are still missing one.” Aspen thought for a moment. “Hmmm…. I don’t think so. There was a time I borrowed a butter knife to have a cheese plate, but I’m pretty certain I returned it.” Odin nodded. “You haven’t visited the agents, right?” “No. Why would I?” “I’m only asking because I think you would think of them as exotic curiosities. They’ve been here for a few weeks; that’s long enough for anyone to meet strangers living in their home, no?” “I-I suppose it would be,” Aspen responded noncommittally. “But you haven’t seen them, of course. Or learned their names.” “Nope!” She busied herself by stopping Odin to mention that this flower pot needed more water. The soil was too dry, and the fern would die without more water. “Any plant dies when it is not given the proper attention and nutrition,” Odin said ominously and swept them onwards. “You know, it’s just been a crazy past few weeks for me.” “How so?” Aspen asked, her voice full of concern. Damn me. She’s pretty, Jeff thought. Her face was tilted at a perfect angle, half in shadow, half glowing a cheery orangey-pink as the natural light playfully shifted. Freckles dusted her cheeks, right under her deep eyes, and also graced her nose-tip. A nose-tip: a simple feature, something that probably shouldn’t hold too much attention on a face, but Jeff had been fascinated with the way hers stuck out just slightly from her nose bridge, a little button nose, for the longest time. And admittedly, he was obsessed with how her thick hair hung heavily, reaching to the floor, matching the graceful swoops of her heavy sea-foam dress that pulled her body down. Even her forehead had the smallest, cutest crease as her brows pulled together ever-so-slightly. He cleared his throat and looked askance, also dropping his arm. Aspen slowly lowered her hand to her side. “Well, my guards have found a strange sock. The sock was all frozen from being outside, as it was stretched over the security camera in the laundry room. Before that, the prisoners somehow got clothes that I didn’t give to them. It gets even stranger. One of the prisoners was missing his cuffs this morning and the other had a plain black hair tie around his wrist that he used to put his hair in a ridiculously small ponytail.” “Really? Which prisoner?” Aspen asked. “Why does it matter?” Odin stopped and faced her again. “I thought you had never even seen them before.” Aspen gulped. Odin resumed their walking. He jammed his fists into his pockets to resist touching Aspen. They now were reaching the spiraling stairs, and they climbed to the second floor, doubling back on their path except for they were a floor above now. “And you know what the strangest thing is, my butterfly?” “What, my prince?” “I seem to remember you waltzing around in a bloody dress on Thanksgiving. A dress that I seem to remember giving you.” “Psh, you’re crazy. That dress had a natural red hem; it matched the rest of it, did you not see it?” “No. I suppose it didn’t catch my eye.” Odin pulled his hands out of his pockets and suddenly pushed Aspen against the wall, widely splaying his fingers on the wall, pinning her in place with his eyes. His eyes that he so wanted to clearly burn with rage and intimidation, but his eyes betrayed him; beneath the wine haze that was slowly overtaking them, lust swirled and sparked in his pupils. He precautionarily barred her shoulders with his elbows. “I don’t remember marrying a liar, Miss Aspen-Fauna.” Aspen screwed up her face to glare at him, wrinkling her nose as his alcoholic breath washed over her bitterly. “I guess you don’t know enough about me, then.” She cut off whatever he was going to reply with by pushing her lips onto his. She knew his weakness: her. She carefully guided Odin’s arms by his biceps, moving his hands onto her hips. She lifted her right leg and wrapped it around Odin, using it as leverage to swivel around him. She ended up in front of him with the open hallway behind her. Odin’s back slammed into the wall. She ran her hands through his hair, ruffling it, stroking her fingertips across his forehead and temples. She parted her lips, but then gently pulled away from his mouth to whisper into his ear. “And I don’t remember dating a psychopath in tenth grade. I remember a sweet, shy, misunderstood boy. I don’t remember a power-hungry man. But now all you are is a dictator, so know this: I did everything. I know Adonis and Sam by name, I gave Sam the knife, the hair tie is mine, I know about the children, I know what you’ve done to my flowers in the valley that you helped me plant last summer. Know this: you will never be enough; you are always going to be second best, a phony, mediocre at everything you ever will attempt to do. You are weak and cowardly. I do not adore who you’ve become and I loath the woman you tried to turn me into. I’m not a liar, I just have a fiery tongue when it’s necessary. I hope you know that now that I know everything,” she paused to push closer to his ear, “I know everything, I am going to destroy you.” She released him and thrust her heels she had slipped off while talking to him into his dumbfounded hands, hands that were still expectantly waiting for her to do more. Then she took off. She sprinted away from the man who was her past and present, and towards the possibility of a future without him. Odin roared. Her heels clattered to the floor. “ASPEN! GET BACK HERE NOW! NOW!” Odin started running after her, but she had a major head start. He had the advantage of longer legs, but the alcohol was finally catching up with him and he fell to his knees and retched. Only bile came up, burning his throat, as he had eaten practically nothing in two days. He immediately got back up and resumed chasing Aspen. The halls were completely empty; servants were practiced at making themselves disappear when Odin was drunk and angry. “ASPEN, MY LOVE! WHERE HAVE YOU ESCAPED THIS TIME!” Aspen was sprinting as fast as she could up the opposite set of spiraling stairs, getting as far away from Odin as possible. The frigid tiles drained the warmth from her feet. Her giddiness at rebellion faded as reality smacked her and she realized just how much danger she would get in if Odin caught up with her. A few tears trickled from her eyes, scattering across her cheeks, propelled by her speed. Her flight was desperate; she hadn’t planned where she was going to go after. In fact, I hadn’t planned this at all! She rounded the stairs to the third floor. Her breaths were short and gaspy. She didn’t know where Odin was, but she knew he was very close behind her. She didn’t know anything except she just needed to run. A door swung open. A flash of movement. Her lungs crumpled as a hand stuck in front of her and caught her ribs. She was yanked out of the hallway.\n↞⇼↠\nAdonis was peacefully napping, catching up on sleep he had missed for the past few days. The sheets on his bed were cool around him, the blankets weighed on him perfectly, giving off the slightest pressure that felt like someone was gently hugging him. He stretched and curled his legs, enjoying the perfect balance. \nA scream shattered the tranquillity. \n“Aspen! Get back here now! Now!” The voice was muffled, but it was clearly Odin’s voice. He was screaming so loud that Adonis could hear him through his doors and the pillow Adonis had thrown over his face. Adonis debated remaining in bed to ignore this debacle, staying suspended between sleeping and wakefulness, but instead jolted out of bed when he heard Odin scream again. \n“Aspen, my love! Where have you escaped this time?” \nAdonis grabbed his lockpick and jumped to his door handle, fumbling the piece of metal into the keyhole. He decided didn’t care whether the guard heard him, but at that same moment, he heard the guard mumble a curse then hurry off, deciding it wasn’t worth the fuss to stick around. \nCome on! Adonis thought desperately.\nThe recent moisture had made the wooden doors swell slightly, messing with all the door locks in the house. \nThe lockpick struggled to find purchase on the latch of the lock. \nFootsteps echoed in the stairwell; Adonis could barely hear each footfall through the wood.\nThe pick scraped across something.\nThe pattering of footsteps got closer. Heavier, louder, footsteps crashed in the stairwell again. \nThe pick clicked. The door swung.\nAdonis thrust his arm out as a blur of Aspen whisked by. She thumped into him as he clenched his elbow, whipping his hand back to himself as quickly as he had thrown it out. He wrapped his arm around her torso firmly and backstepped with her into the room. Her dress, billowing wide behind her moments ago, crushed around her legs and lost all momentum. Adonis saw a pissed, and probably wasted, Odin emerge shakily from the staircase at the edge of his vision. He snapped the doors shut and twisted the lock with the pick, still holding Aspen around her ribs with the arm farther away from the entryway. The small shaft of metal slipped from his fingers and fell to the flooring as Aspen’s rattling breaths turned into full gasps and the few tears clinging on her ethereal face turned into many. \nOdin efficiently, and noisily, ran through the hallway, pounding on each door. “ASPEN! ASPEN, MY LOVE! WHERE DID YOU GO! WHERE ARE YOU HIDING!” His voice took on a maniacal edge. He smashed a flower pot to emphasize himself. The smash echoed in the stone hallway, clanging viciously against Adonis’ eardrums. Adonis was angry and a little shocked at how much Odin was a sad, slimy, weak excuse for a human, so evil that he would attack his own house and wife. \nOdin continued to screech in the hall. \n“What did you do, Aspen?” Adonis asked her in a low voice, clutching her protectively to his chest. \n“I told him what he deserved to hear,” Aspen answered in a surprisingly hard voice, but Adonis felt her start to shake, and her panicky gasps were progressively getting louder. Adonis slowly backed them away from the entrance, the hand resting on her hip guiding her backwards with him, the other hand gently covering her mouth with his sleeve to gently muffle her breaths. \n“Shh, Aspen. It’s ok. You’re safe with me. Odin can’t get us,” Adonis murmured. He sat them down on the rug. \nHe’s still getting closer. Adonis clasped Aspen in his lap and he swayed back and forth slightly, trying to calm her. \nOdin stopped outside and pounded on the doors. “Hey short freak! Are you holding my little butterfly in there? She seems to have flown away!” he cackled, beating the doors so hard small puffs of dust escaped from the cracks. Aspen needed more attention than he did right now, but Adonis could feel his own anxiety rising. She shivered so much Adonis thought his own body was trembling. \n“Aspen, what’s your favorite place in the whole world?” Adonis asked her softly. \n“Anywhere tropical,” she whispered back.\n“I need you to imagine yourself in that tropical paradise,” Adonis said, leaning closer to her ear. “Hear the birds? Feel the sun. Smell that beautiful flower for me. I’m right here with you, and I’m not going to let you go until you’re ready, okay?”\nShe nodded and reached her right hand towards Adonis’. He moved his palm from her hip to lace her fingers with his. He did not mind helping Aspen, and he wished he could dedicate all his energy to her, but he needed to prevent his own anxiety attack. He squeezed his eyes shut, trying to block out Odin’s ruckus and every other outside distraction. He imagined himself into his own safe place; a rocky cliff overlooking a great, churning sea. Sea spray washed over his face, cleansing him. \nAspen saw her palm trees sway gently. Her ocean was a much calmer version than Adonis' vision, gentle crystal-blue waves lapping over her feet and swirling away again. She had been to her tropical paradise many times before in her mind, run the golden sand through her fingers, seen the vibrant hibiscus flowers of every color grow in even the tiniest corners of light; she wondered how she had never noticed the feeling of loneliness in this place before. She wished she had someone to wander around her paradise with. \nOdin was now harassing Sam’s room. He must be almost done. Then I’m sure Sam will sneak over and help us. Adonis slowly rubbed circles on Aspen’s stomach, and moved the hand from her mouth to her ribcage to pull her even closer. He hugged her snugly and buried his face into the crook of her neck and left shoulder. Her crying reduced to pitiful hiccups. \nThe pair didn’t move for a whole ten minutes. Adonis didn’t let a single muscle twitch, almost in the hopes that Aspen could forget he was even there and allow herself ample recovery time. Odin’s sounds of raging had gotten quieter; Adonis surmised he had moved onto different floors of the house or maybe had given up. He moved only when he heard his doorknob’s lock jiggle again. He lifted his head slightly to stare at the threshold. Aspen didn’t react to the sound or to the slight lift of Adonis’ head.\nSam tiptoed in, duffel bag slung over his shoulder, and relocked the door. Adonis silently stared into Sam’s eyes, then nuzzled his head back into Aspen’s shoulder. Sam took in Adonis, sadness emanating from his body, then Aspen, a huddled figure who looked so small against Adonis’ chest. He looked to the floor and shook his head, then padded to the bathroom, filled a cup with water from the tap, then squatted next to Adonis and Aspen. \n“Hey. Can you drink some water? It’ll make you feel better,” Sam asked, holding the cup aloft. Aspen opened her eyes languidly and accepted the drink, pulling her hands free from Adonis’ arms. He still stubbornly had his head at her shoulder, savoring the warmth there, and had his arms placed where they wouldn’t interfere with her own arm movements.  \nAspen gently tapped the back of Adonis’ hand, and he released his arms from her, but she made no move to leave his lap. He didn’t mind; whatever made her most comfortable was fine with him. She wordlessly passed the cup back to Sam, and the boys waited for her to speak. \n“Thank you,” she said quietly. \n“Of course, Aspen,” Sam replied. He reached his hand to graze her cheek. She caught it with her fingertips and pressed his warm palm to her cold cheek. \n“Sam, Adonis, were you guys trained for this?” Aspen asked, gesturing wide with her hands at nothing in particular. “Was it part of your training?”\n“No. I know a bit of this because Adonis has anxiety. He knows how to handle it pretty well, but I’ve helped him through a couple anxiety attacks,” Sam explained, his hand still held to Aspen’s face. \n“But neither of us were prepared to deal with a wild Odin,” Adonis spoke tenderly. “I’m so sorry for all the pain that man has dragged you through.”\n“You mean that monster has dragged me through. I’m ashamed that I ever married him,” Aspen said. Hate edged her words, and each syllable lanced through Adonis and made Sam cringe. \n“Aspen, you know none of this is your fault, right? You can’t hold guilt for something you have no control over,” Adonis asked.\n“But I did have control! I was in the adoption system my whole childhood, and when I turned eighteen, Jeff asked me to move into his grandfather’s manor with him, so that I wouldn’t be turned to the streets as I aged out. I was young, not stupid, but young and desperate and in love. I noticed how suspicious Odin started becoming when he didn’t come to dinners with me anymore, and he started yelling at me out of nowhere, but how could I complain! He had given me a house and love and a future when I thought I didn’t have one!” She lowered her voice for the last few lines and dropped Sam’s hand. So much self-loathing penetrated her words they stung Sam and Adonis. “If only I had not been a wimp, back when I first noticed his behavior becoming problematic, I could have prevented so much pain for so many people. So yes, I do hold guilt for this situation because it is my fault.” \nAdonis and Sam overlapped each other as they spoke, both saying no many times. Sam got control: “Aspen, that is crap and you know it. You deserve no guilt from this. I don’t care how you argue the blame towards yourself; none of this is your fault. Absolutely none of it.” Sam leaned forward to crush her in a hug. \n“Don’t dwell on the possibilities either. Even if you had talked to Odin, even if you had stopped him temporarily, even if you hadn’t moved in with him, there’s no guarantee that it wouldn’t have turned out exactly like it already did,” Adonis re-laced his arms around her midsection while whispering in her ear. Aspen nodded, a blush feathering her cheeks. \n“Aspen, do you think you can stand? I have some clothes you can change into if you want,” Sam asked, kneeling to his bag and pulling out a pair of his sweatpants. “Also, thanks for the knife. It’s been really helpful.” “You’re welcome,” Aspen said. She let the back of her head drop to Adonis’ shoulder to look into his eyes. “But, can I borrow your clothes, Adonis? I feel like they might fit me better.” Adonis grinned. “Yeah. Do you want your hair tie back?” Adonis stood and pulled Aspen up with him. “No, you can keep it.” She thought for a second and added, “Only if you put your hair up in a ponytail though.” She stumbled to the bathroom to change after Adonis passed her his sweatshirt and sweatpants, the last clean set he had. He worried about having to share his clothes with Aspen while at Francis’, but they would figure it out. Aspen closed the door. Sam crossed his arms and stared at the floor, and Adonis leaned on his bed post. “Sam,” Adonis said in an undertone. “Yeah?” “I don’t care what we have to do, but Aspen needs to come with us tonight.”"

    "text": "Aspen pressed the flashlight into Sam’s hand and removed the wall panel to the passageway, pushing Adonis in first when he hesitated. Sam flicked on the flashlight after she closed them in. She grabbed the flashlight from Sam and led confidently, walking Sam and Adonis through a labyrinthine course that was even shorter than the one they already had planned from Francis’ crude map. Aspen turned the light off as soon as she saw the wisp of fabric of the laundry room fluttering in front of them. She stepped out, checking no one was lying in wait, and signaled the agents to follow her a moment later. \n“Hey-!” Aspen’s outburst was muffled. Sam and Adonis halted right behind the fabric, crouching in the shadows. “Put me down!”\nSam forced his eyes wider, willing more light to come into existence, trying to decipher what was happening. A hulking, wiggling mass was all he could spot. “No. Right now, you’re gonna listen to me, and you better remember everything I have to say. I have been nothing but a faithful, diligent husband. You have been nothing but a lying wench. Who took you in after you aged out of the adoption system? Who gave you a home, a good life?” \nAspen didn’t answer. It became clear to Sam that part of the hulking, wiggling mass was Odin.\nOdin bent his head closer to her ear. “Who knows you so well that he can guess how you’re going to escape?”\n“Who has a knife and is going to slice your throat unless you release Aspen and let us leave?” Sam now stood behind Odin. He clenched the front of Odin’s throat with his left hand and trained the knife on the back of Odin’s throat with his right. One small jerk stood between Odin’s life and death; Sam resisted slashing the tender skin only so he wouldn’t become a murderer. Still, he allowed himself to press the blade in enough to leave a small cut, though hopefully deep enough to leave a permanent, ugly scar on Odin’s precious neck. \nSam felt Odin tense, struggling to breath underneath Sam’s iron grip. Sam knew his fingers were going to leave bruises. Odin froze but didn’t let go of Aspen. Off to the side, Adonis hefted an iron he had found on a shelf, ready to smack Odin if he refused to release Aspen from his grip. \nOdin’s pulse fluttered in his neck, pulsing his blood onto the knife tip. Sam hovered the knife only slightly off Odin’s neck, and a thin line of his blood wound down the blade and Sam’s hand, weaving between his fingers. \n“C’mon Odin, do something decent for once,” Sam fervently whispered.\nOdin cussed with the small amount of air he had left in his lungs. He finally let Aspen out of his arms. \n“Aspen, Adonis, go. I’ll catch up,” Sam commanded. They had no time to debate, so they crept out. Sam walked backwards to the door, still clutching Odin. He lifted the knife from his neck to bring his arm up, then smashed his elbow onto the crown of Odin’s head. He slumped to the floor. Sam let himself out of the door, kicked Odin’s limp feet back over the threshold, and slammed it shut. He sprinted to the shed. The ground was slick and he struggled to stay upright, especially without the assistance of snow boots. He sped past a guard, who was briefly frozen in confusion, but then they raised a shout. The guard started chasing, quickly gaining on Sam because they did have snow shoes. Sam gave up on running and jumped, thrusting his bag underneath him, landing on it and sliding across the ice. His ride stopped when he smashed into the side of the slightly-rotted planks of the shed. His shoulder and the side of his ribs throbbed from his crash, but he immediately launched himself away from the wall, stumbling to the overgrown storm drain. He almost missed it in the wan light, but the grate opened from the inside and Sam saw Adonis’ face. He chucked his duffel bag into the dark hole and crumpled to the ground to follow, squeezing through the narrow opening, nearly falling on top of Aspen. Adonis dropped the grate. The trio crouched low, listening to the guard pounding around above and hoping they wouldn’t shine their flashlight down the hole. \n“Let’s go,” Adonis whispered. They stood and walked away from Odin Manor, retreating through the square concrete passages. \n↞⇼↠\nDecember 9, 4:07 A.M.: Odin read the note again and again, shaking with rage. I should have just killed her. Killed them. Killed all of them. How stupid was I to let them go? He crumpled the slip of paper and threw it and the dress it had been resting on out of the window. If Aspen wanted it back, she could always just get the dress herself. The only thing the note had said was, in a very messy, sloped scrawl: ‘I hate you. I hope you have a horrible life! -Adonis.’ Odin picked up his sword from the floor and clenched the handle. He had been walking around with it all night, refusing to put it back on its holders until he got the chance to use it. Flexing his wrist, he glared at the silvery blade, slowly turning the sword one rotation. He left Adonis’ room and stalked to the basement.\n“Any final words? Any desire to admit your guilt so you can die with a clean mind?” Odin asked the thin, shivering boy in front of him. He had seen the security footage this morning, and this weakling in front of him was clearly part of the escape plan. “No. My ‘mind’ is plenty clean, thank you,” the guard said. “Rest well,” Odin said. Sam hadn’t killed Odin because he didn’t want to wear the title of ‘murderer.’ Odin had no such reservations. He swiped his sword, felt the razor edge catch on muscle and bone momentarily, then slash through. He watched the young guard, nameless to him like so many other children, breathe for the last time, blink for the last time. He watched the boy fall for the last time, watched his head topple. Odin watched his ruby blood splatter. He watched the fifteen-year-old boy die. Odin knelt to wipe the blood off on the guard’s own uniform. He ordered the guard’s comrade to dispose of the body."

    "text": "↞⇼↠\n“Sammy! So good you’re home!” Aspen yelled at eleven-twenty when Sam stumbled through the front door, laden with food. She ran up to him and hugged him, almost making him drop all the food.\n“Aspen, shhh! Francis and Ariadne are asleep,” Adonis ran up and pulled her off Sam. \n“Did you tell her to call me Sammy? Really?” Sam asked. “Not funny, Adonis.” Adonis held back his laughter and helped carry the food to the kitchen. \n“Sorry I was loud, I just woke up,” Aspen explained, yawning. She plopped down on the couch, folding her legs up. “I’m so tired.”\n“It’s fine. What happened while I was gone?” Sam asked, thinking that her outburst was actually quite funny. Aspen drifted while Adonis explained her ideas to Sam. \n“What are you going to do once you have Odin, Aspen?” Sam asked her, jerking her into wakefulness. “Do you think you’re going to kill him, to repay for all his crimes?”\nAspen felt like ice froze her heart. “He-I-” she stuttered. “We can’t become him! If I killed him, if we killed him, we’d be just as bad as him! You don’t understand the full picture.”\n“Then make me understand, Aspen,” Sam asked. “I don’t mean to upset you, I just want to know what your purpose for cornering him is.”\nShe hesitated, then started. “He has reasoning behind everything he’s doing. It’s illogical, nonsensical, but it used to be for noble reasons. Is it alright if I go all the way back? I feel like it’s more understandable, then,” she fidgeted with her fingernails. Adonis and Sam nodded. “He is the youngest child in his family, with two older brothers. His brothers are five and seven years older than him, and both were very athletic. One even became a professional swimmer. His other brother became a lawyer. Jeff, when he was younger, he just wanted to mess around with computers, which his parents saw as pointless and they didn’t really respect that, or him in general. On top of all of that, his parents often overlooked him because he was, as they called him,” Aspen cleared her throat, “an unexpected surprise. So he always tried to get his parents’ attention by excelling in all of his classes, but it was never enough. In eighth grade, they sent him to live here, in the states with some random cousin. When he turned eighteen, he inherited his grandfather’s manor, this one.” \nShe took a deep breath. “Basically, what I’m trying to say is all he ever wanted his whole life was control. Control to feel special, the best, being able to control when he got attention. He never got it, so he turned to controlling people. When I first met him, he told me how he wanted to have many children and treat all of them fairly, and I admired him. I thought his dream of a world where everyones’ talents were accepted and appreciated was incredible, and I followed him for years. It wasn’t until it was too late to turn back that I realized how horribly wrong his desire for control had gotten.” Neither of the agents said anything for a few minutes, allowing her words to sink in. They were just beginning to grasp the depths of pain that had led Odin to here. They wondered how different life could have turned for him if only his parents had approved of his hobby. “Even if you hated him with every fiber of your being, you couldn’t kill him, could you? A part of you still wants to see the boy you fell in love with,” mused Adonis. “Yes. As much as I hate myself for it, I still can see his humanity.” “Then don’t worry, we aren’t going to kill him,” Sam said. He added cheerily, “He’s just going on a short trip to federal prison for the rest of his life.” Aspen smiled, warmed by Sam’s gently simmering hatred."

    "text": "Sam and Francis left first, right after a quick breakfast, so they could drive up while it was still dark. Francis directed their car through the most circuitous route possible to make following them difficult if any trackers were set after them. Ariadne left second after packing the trunk of her car full with supplies, raiding almost all of the food that Sam had bought just eight hours ago. She wished Aspen and Adonis good luck with their tasks for the day, and since they would probably be the first ones done, that they were allowed to do anything they wanted at the house when they got back. Adonis and Aspen were the last to leave, and since it wouldn’t matter too much whether it was day or night for them, they got ready leisurely. They finally went outside at eight AM, encased in layers of winter coats, scarves, hats, pants, mittens and socks in the darkest colors they could find. They pulled the scarves high above their noses and the hats low on their forehead so only their eyes could be seen. When they stepped out, the clouds that had been looming for days finally released their tempest. Rain mixed with hail lashed at the buildings and lightning lanced the sky, its after-product of thunder cracking and booming violently. Francis’ house and those around it were built from red bricks with jade ivy creeping up them; the lances of water and ice were so strong the leaves were shredded. The gutters next to the black pavement swirled with grey water and the strips of yellow painted on the road glimmered in the wetness and half-light. The wind whipped through the streets irregularly with quick ferocity, jangling the neighbor’s wind chimes and ripping through the bare branches of gangly maple trees. Any trace of dust was pelted away by the icy water, cleansed and refreshed. The whole street, surely once full of warm fireplaces and family gatherings at this time of year, was hollow, desolate and creepy. To Adonis, it felt like he was disrespectfully trampling around a dystopian mausoleum. Adonis and Aspen trudged through the rain, hunching under eaves and dashing from cover to cover. At one point, Aspen fell behind and Adonis ran back to her. “Aspen! What’s wrong?” he yelled over the storm. “Nothing! I just love thunderstorms!” she yelled back jubilantly. She had fallen behind because she was watching the clouds for more flashes. Adonis agreed that thunderstorms were amazing, but lightly pulled her away with her wrist; as much as he yearned to watch for lightning with her, finding hiding places for a team of people was more essential. They slinked around the streets until 4:00 PM, declaring almost twenty houses as safe after checking if they were abandoned and removing all the security bugs they could find. They were almost caught a few times by Odin’s security; ever since they had gotten away, pairs of security members walked Briarcliff’s streets, looking out for any sign of Sam, Adonis or Aspen. Sometimes while Adonis and Aspen were in a house, the guards would break the door and barge in, making them have to quickly jump into closets or cupboards. The huffs of their breaths were strained when these moments happened, and Adonis’ and Aspen’s hearts skipped every time the soldiers stepped on nearby floorboards or yelled to each other. The pair waited long minutes after the soldiers left as noisily as they came, fearful they would come back. Inching back out, Aspen and Adonis would stare at each other’s eyes through cracks, and then tenderly ease out and creep around the rest of the house. When they decided a house was completely clean, they marked it by jamming a small pebble into the cracks of the front doors. Finally, after sloshing through the streets and slumping back to Francis’ house late that afternoon, they stepped through his threshold sopping wet, cold, tired and hungry. Francis and Sam had still not returned from their mission. “Aspen, do you want soup or something?” Adonis called from the kitchen. Aspen had immediately ran to the living room, moved the coffee table to the side, pulled out the hidden bed from the couch that she and Adonis had shared last night, and crashed on it. Adonis had run to the kitchen and sifted through the cabinets for something to eat. Their winter clothes lay in a jumbled heap next to the front door. Aspen clicked through the stations on the television, pausing her searching once she found her favorite fashion show playing. “Yeah, can you also bring some chips?” “Mhm.” Adonis microwaved two bowls of canned tomato soup, cracked fresh pepper on top of the warmed bowls, and grabbed a bag of barbeque-flavored potato chips. He joined Aspen on the couch, handing her a bowl as she draped a thick blanket over them. He saw her choice and said, “Oh, I love this show!”\nHis head dropped to her shoulder to share her warmth as they watched the episode. Adonis glanced at the clock on the wall when the episode ended, reading 5:26 PM. “I wonder why they aren’t back yet,” he mumbled. He turned his head to look at Aspen’s face. Thick lashes framed her eyes, casting a light shadow onto her lower eyelids, adding layers to their ocean depths. Her eyelashes were a shade lighter than he normally saw them because she had no mascara on. “It’s alright with you if I lay my head on you, right? I show affection through touch, but if it makes you uncomfortable, please tell me.” “No, it’s fine. I’m touchy too,” she said while scratching his scalp with her nail tips. She stretched away momentarily to place their bowls and the bag of chips on the coffee table, then shifted Adonis so his back rested against her chest and she had free reign over his hair. She combed through his thick locks with her fingers and rebraided it, making it much more complicated than the previous. She worked in three small braids that started thin and got thicker towards the back of his head, then wove them together and tied them off with a small, fluffy pony tail sticking out at the base of his head. Neither of them noticed as they slowly drifted to sleep, and neither of them woke when Sam and Francis returned, their mission having gone successfully. The backup the agency managed to gather was forty strong, and five were going to leave for the lake in the morning to meet Ariadne, and the others were going to stay safely hidden in the houses and wait for more instructions. “Do you think we should wake them to move them to their bedrooms?” Francis asked, bending to pick up Adonis’ and Aspen’s head of soiled clothes. “It’s almost ten.” “No. They look comfortable,” Sam said, stretching and preparing to go to his own bed. “Besides, they look really cute.” And so Adonis and Aspen were left alone, together, on the lumpy pullout mattress.\nAdonis jumped awake, panicking momentarily as he thought he was trapped. In reality, it was just Aspen’s arms lightly resting on him, but in his half-asleep state, they felt like weighty chains anchoring him to this world. He fought off her arms and sat up, slouching over his folded legs and clutching his forehead. Aspen slowly woke and watched him. His back quivered, and she could see him hunched over, even in the dark. She waited for a couple minutes before asking, “What’s wrong?” He took so long to answer she thought he might not answer at all. “I had a dream about my dad.” His voice was throaty, as if he had been crying. “Francis reminds me so much of him.” “What was your father like?” Adonis sat back into her arms, feeling the fingers of the dead swipe at him, wiping away ghost tears from his face. “He was…an enigma. A good man. A good dad.” Adonis struggled to think of the right words. “When I was younger, I loved to wear skirts and blazers and dresses and board shorts. I still do- clothes are a form of expression. He always told me how good I looked in everything, and when kids made fun of me for ‘dressing like a girl,’ he always told me fabric doesn’t have a gender, and why should I care what others think if I like it? “He taught me to respect. Respect elders, parents, superiors, boys, girls. He taught me chivalry and manners. He taught me how to be a decent human being.” Aspen stared at him, analyzing his face in the small moonlight that her eyes had adjusted to. She saw his wet eyes, blushing cheeks, crinkles fanning from his nose bridge. She heard the admiration, the praise, the happiness in his voice. And she also heard pain and regret and deep sadness. Adonis’ eyes were locked to the wall. He swiped at his nose and eyes, sniffling quietly. “And then he was gone. I had him for thirteen years, and then the doctors gave him too many painkillers and he was gone.” Aspen stared at the wall too. “I’m so sorry, Adonis.” He answered softly, “Don’t be. He was sick for a long time. And loads of people have dead people. I’m not the only person to ever be sad, so I can’t really be sad about this.” “Other people’s pain doesn’t invalidate yours.” Aspen held him like he had held her, refusing to let him go until he wanted to. He cried silently, not even his breathing making noise. Eventually, they were both pulled back into sleep.\n↞⇼↠\nAdonis and Aspen were not the only restless sleepers that night. A large, mid-thirties guard was tromping around Odin manor, crushing rocks and ice beneath his heavy winter boots. Since Odin had been incapacitated when the agents managed to sneak away, he hadn’t seen which guard had been on patrolling duty, so this guard had also managed to escape his punishments. Even so, the guard still felt jumpy and uncomfortable, as though he was white-hot iron on an anvil waiting for the hammer to strike. He stopped at the shed where he had lost the agents, inspecting the area for any sort of clue as to where they had gone. They just vanished. One second I saw them, and then they were gone! he thought anxiously, knowing it was a weak excuse to cover himself if Odin were to push him. He put his flashlight in his mouth and broke through the thin door on the shed, more concerned about himself than the state of the shed’s door. He frantically dug through piles of dusty tools, seed packets and bags of soil, shattering pots and disorganizing everything in his desperation. His stomach dropped as he found nothing incriminating in the shed, not a secret door, not a footprint, not even a scrap from one of their clothing items. He backpedaled out of the shed, feeling his heart beginning to race. His hands shook, and the rain was still pelting ferociously outside as it had the whole day, soaking through his guard’s vest as he tried to prop up the sagging door he had just broken minutes ago. He dashed around the shed, once, twice, and on the third time, he tripped and fell onto the rough pavement, painfully pushing all the air out of his lungs as he crashed. He muttered a curse darkly and slowly rose to his hands and knees on all fours. His flashlight had rollen away some feet, and he leaned to grab it, looking around for what had tripped him. He was close to the border of the forest, so he thought maybe a root or a rock had made him fall. Instead, he found a poorly concealed rusty grate. The area around it made it look like it hadn’t been used in at least ten years, with creepers and detritus nearly covering the entire thing. The hail had pelted away at the covering, exposing the old metal to the rain. There weren’t any footprints near it, but there wouldn’t be anyways after the rain had poured and gurgled down the drain, whisking away anything that might have been left behind from the agents. The guard carefully lifted the grate and climbed down the shaky ladder, dropping the last few feet into the cavern below and listening warily as his feet made ominous, echoey ripples in the stagnant water. Dark tunnels were in front and behind him. His flashlight barely made a difference, and the whole concrete structure had a ghastly, haunting look to it from the wan light shining through the grate. His satisfaction rose tremendously as his flashlight caught on a scrap of waterproof fabric, the same fabric Sam’s duffel bag had been made of. He probably shredded the bottom when he slid away from me. He fingered the fabric, thinking. If he found the agents, he would also have to turn over Aspen-Fauna, a lovely woman who had always been solicitous. She had comforted him one night when he was first brought to the manor and he learned that his twin brother, who lived in the ‘big city,’ was badly injured in a car accident. That was months ago, when he got the quick call from some Helena hospital’s nurse to deliver that horrible message. With Odin’s massive restrictions on cellular communication, he got no further updates and presently was still uncertain whether his twin was alive or not. Sure, before the restrictions, the guard hadn’t been the closest with his brother, but it still hurt a lot to hear that your only sibling was in critical condition with his body ripped crosswise. The guard just decided to assume his twin had passed in order to save himself from prolonging grieving by uncertainly waiting forever. I should have talked to him more. He’s gone now. I can’t believe how wide the rift between us grew without us noticing. I barely talked to him, then he was rent head-to-hip and died. The guard sniffed, crinkling his nose, and shook his head to clear his twin from his mind.\nEven though he was older than Miss Fauna, she seemed much more aware and developed beyond her years, and had patiently comforted him with a practiced method again when he realized he would probably never see his parents again. She had secretly comforted innumerable guards, recruits, and children, risking her safety from Odin to offer a hug or kind word to a housestaff. The guard almost blushed a little when he remembered how tenderly she had hugged him. The tiniest smile lit his face. She was so small, light, warm, and perfect. Ah, I wish that I could find a girl like that. Odin is one lucky dude. He tucked the scrap of fabric into a pocket in his pants. He mindlessly climbed the ladder to the grate he had left propped open using a stout stick. He punched the stick out after reaching his arms out and dragging more leaves over to cover the grate. The stick clattered drily against the rocky street. He grinned and dropped from the ladder. His loudly echoing splashes sounded much more tamed and distant now. His flashlight also seemed to be brighter, penetrating the darkness efficiently. He even swore that he could feel the sensation of Aspen’s arms wrapping around his midsection again, feel the warmth of her face the same as when she had pressed it into his abdomen as he crumpled around her, the slow stroking of her fingertips on his back to comfort him as he sobbed. Imagine the glory I could win if I find them."

    "text": "↞⇼↠\nI clambered into the front seat of the car to drive it. Unluckily, all the vans from the agency are bright white, which is not good for stealth missions. This car was Francis’ neighbors’ car, an old, black, mid-size 2013 model. Sam and Adonis knew how to hotwire, and Francis decided his nonexistent neighbors wouldn’t mind if their car was stolen in order to free their children. Another complication to the plan was that all the cars we were going to steal had to be older models; newer cars had steering features against hotwiring that forced the car to only drive in a straight line. A complication I’m glad I don’t have to deal with, I thought wittily. \n“Trinity!” I unrolled the window as I heard Selena call to me. She leaned over to hug my neck. “Goodluck.”\n“Thanks. Bye everyone!” Sam, Francis, Aspen and Adonis all waited in a clump next to the front door, shivering in the cold. They retreated inside with Selena as I grabbed the passenger headrest and reversed out of the neighbor’s driveway. Addressing the four others in the small black car I said, “Let’s go.”\nAs we wound our way to the lake, the massive rainstorm was finally beginning to look like it was lifting. Good timing, actually. It should make the dirt, or whatever material is next to the main road at the lake, softer and easier to move.\nJust like Francis had said, the drive to the lake was short. In only twenty minutes we made it to the tall slate cliff sides that made up the mountains surrounding the entire valley. Even though the anvil thunderheads were drifting away slowly, water still ran in rivulets all down the rocky faces, and the lake still had strips of fog weightlessly swirling on it. \nI parked the car under a solitary giant pine and stopped the engine by unfastening the ignition and battery wires. My cohorts unloaded the trunk where we had shoved in more tents and food and started walking around the lake to reach the far western edge. I almost slammed the door shut, but decided to leave it open so I wouldn’t have to break into the car and set of it’s alarm. I was scared about the battery dying, but shouldn’t have to drive it again; if I did have to drive it again, it would only be because the plan went poorly. \nGrabbing the last two bundles of supplies, I did kick the trunk closed and followed the uneven footsteps left behind in the fine gravel. The scenery was strange: the mist muffled almost all sounds, and sometimes it was so thick I couldn’t see in front of myself and I almost ran into grey rocks or the grey-tinted trees. That was another thing; everything was grey, misty, drab, with the only small pop of color coming from the viridian leaves on shrubs and evergreens. My breath curled in white wisps in front of me when I exhaled, and when I inhaled, my throat burned from the cold. The lake was at even higher elevation than the rest of the valley, and each breath was insignificant and left my body craving more oxygen. The edge of the lake had thin sheets of ice floating on its surface that melded into hoarfrost creeping up the shore, freezing small pebbles together. \n“Trinity! Are you out there?” one of my companions called. I wasn’t incredibly far behind them, but remembering how Sam told me to stop the car took longer than I thought it would. \n“Yep! I’m coming!” I yelled back. I walked another ten feet, and through the shifting fingers of fog, I saw a red-golden glow softly illuminating the air. A small area had been cleared beneath a craggy overhang and I saw a woman I hadn’t met before, hunched over and tending the coals. The other four people I brought with me worked in groups of two to set up tents, tarps and rainflies. I dropped my bundles onto the pile behind her and said, “Hey, you must be Ariadne? I’m Trinity, the unofficial leader of this little pack.”\n“Pleasure to meet you. Ready to help save the small world of Briarcliff?” she asked.\nI smiled. “I’ll do my best, ma’am.” \n\n“Steady, okay, now just fit the rope into the pulley!” Will, another agent, called to Trinity over the roar of the wind. The group had traversed around the lake again, and now were at the east side of it, fighting to stay balanced on the steep cliff faces while they were buffeted with gusts. Trinity, Ariadne and two more agents stood on one high precipice, and Will stood on one opposite them, about twenty-five feet apart. The main road was in between them, and a rope was stretched from a pulley in Ariadne’s hand to Will’s hand. Will tied the end that he had to a large, but old, tree. The tree looked as though it would be impossible to pull out of the ground because of its age and probably countless roots, but it was actually dead and hollowed out; it looked like it had been struck with lightning years ago. Will finished fashioning his knot and yelled, “Pull!”\nThe last agent they had brought with them was on the road, slightly farther up it to be precautionary. The group of four yanked hard on the rope, struggling to stay upright in the slick mud, and Will backpedaled away from the tree as it lurched. The hollow wood was gratingly dragged over the edge of the drop, and with a resounding boom, it crashed to the road below it. It was so long it got stuck in between the two cliffs, the rooted part of sticking into the air. The agent on the road ran up to inspect its placement and make sure it was secure. He gave a thumbs up and the team cheered.\nNow we just need to shove some rocks in the way as realistically as possible, Trinity thought. They were trying to block the main entrance to the lake so it would be harder to find them. If Odin even guessed that they were staying at this distant lake and tried to pursue them, he would have to first know of or discover the secret way in, and secondly sneak past the security they were going to put there. \nSo, for the next three hours, in a mist that was light yet heavy enough to slowly soak their clothing, the agents pushed rocks and branches into the road and smeared handfuls of mud all over the blockade, as well as drew streaks behind it to make realistic pathways as to where all these boulders and branches could have rolled in from. \n↞⇼↠\nThe backup plus the agents plus Aspen plus Francis almost numbered the original count of back up before five had gone to the lake. Thirty-nine people crammed into the corner of a house, a house just across the street from Francis’. Aspen was addressing them all, trying to talk loud enough so everyone could hear her but not so loud anyone outside would be able to. She told everyone how she needed seven more volunteer drivers who were good at memorizing directions and everyone else was going to follow her into the storm drains. Six people volunteered easily, but when a seventh was indecisive, Francis took the spot.\nAspen quickly explained her plan through again, speaking so quickly that she hoped her audience had good memories. She knew that in order for her idea to work, they needed to act quickly on it now. The large group that wasn’t the drivers was broken into smaller groups; a tiny cluster of three who were going to leave the building first and restrain any nearby guards to make sure the pathway was clear to the entrance of the underground rain gutter; a group that was going to escort the children back to the cars; and a last group that was going to follow Sam and Adonis, after the children were handled, to takeover the perimeter of the house. When Aspen finished, she stepped back to lean against a wall, allowing a moment for her ideas to sink in. A few scattered drops of water splashed against the floor, dripping from a fist-sized hole in the roof. Sam stepped forward and began the mission by snapping his fingers then flicking his hand to the door twice; from now on, they were going to be as quiet as possible. The cluster of three were passed extra scarves, and they crept outside. Everyone else tensely waited inside, some tentatively rising to their feet. Two of them came back, dragging Odin’s guards backwards by the scarves they shoved in their mouths. The third crouched under the eave outside, their squinted flinty eyes scanning the road for more of Odin’s puppets while retying their scarf to hide their nose, lips and chin. The group filed while the guards were restrained with tight bands of tape around their wrists, elbows, knees, calves and ankles. The scarves they were reined in with were also tightly knotted around the back of their head.\nFrancis led the six drivers away with him to the cars. Their need for memorizing directions came in then; instead of all concentrating at one storm drain, they were going to scatter to seven different entrances. After hijacking the biggest, darkest cars the agents could find, they drove to their manholes and parked, praying there would be enough space for all the children. There could be a hundred or a thousand children there, Francis thought grimly. Aspen said she saw what she thought were hundreds of tents staked in the ice, but she was also stressed and shell-shocked; she might have accidentally inflated the number. Although Francis desperately wanted all the children, the pure, innocent children to be rescued, his selfish priority was to see Ambar and Coliban out first. He didn’t like physical touch very much, but he ached with desire to embrace them. He ached to bring his family all back together, to just watch Ambar and Coliban talk or play or even fight. He just wanted to hear their voices, together.\nAspen and Adonis dashed ahead, leading. Their skin felt prickly and sensitive, high alert at all times. Their jogging from structure to structure and dodging behind them tired them and made them gasp, but instead of the ice-air stabbing their lungs, it refreshed them and cleared their minds. Sam trailed at the end of the group, defending their back. He was on high-alert as well, but he was even more stressed then the others. He jogged backwards loosely, his baggy sweatshirt and fluffy hair flouncing slightly with each little jump he did, trying to prevent tripping. His right hand subtly rested on a heavy, angular metal object in his pants’ pocket. Adonis and Sam, along with the other agents, were trained to use guns, but Adonis hated them because he thought they were cruel, unnecessary, messy, loud, hard to aim, and a million other horrible things. He also had the long smuggled knife tucked in a sheath he fashioned to a belt loop on his left side, bouncing along with each jerk of his hip. He didn’t want to use the gun, but he also wasn’t going to allow anything to mess up the plan, the last chance he would probably ever get to dethrone the twisted king that was Odin. The group reached the storm drain and quickly dispersed into the alleys and shadows of the worn-brick building walls. Sam circled to the front with Aspen and Adonis and dug his fingers into the tiny crack around the manhole cover. “Three, two, one,” Aspen counted. She had two fingers shoved into one of the small finger-holes, and Adonis crammed his middle finger into the other and clutched that hand with his other one to give more support. Even though it had been exceedingly easy to get out of the manhole cover when they snuck into Francis’ house, it was much harder to get in because they had to pull the cumbersome cover up instead of just pushing it out. The three strained for a few seconds, grunting and pulling, till the metal finally slid noisily out of place and allowed them to get in. Adonis jumped in immediately, Aspen hovered near the opening so she could push the lid back in place, and Sam herded the group over as they trickled out of their hiding spots. The agents efficiently made their way in, and Aspen closed them inside the concrete cavern after shoving the lid halfway over, slipping in, and fighting the last half of it back in place. It landed slightly crooked, but since the rest of the mission was only going to take a few hours, she didn’t care enough to fix it. She pulled a small keychain flashlight from her back pocket, balanced it in her teeth, and dropped from the ladder, falling almost ten feet to the murky water and sending a cascade of stagnant water straight into her pristine hair. “Lovely. That’s going to be fun to rinse out later,” she said in a fake-disgusted voice. She spat the small flashlight into the palm of her hand and shook her head to fluff out her hair. “Nice splash,” Adonis said, sidling next to her. “But I’m afraid we have a complication.” Confused, Aspen looked up at his face, searching his features for something amiss, then turned to the group, all who were clustered in the center of the dingy passage. She gently tapped their shoulders and parted the wall of flesh. Sam was facing her, but was halfway bent over behind a cowering man who had his face angled to the water and his hands above his head. Sam pressed the cold metal gun in his hand to the man’s head. Ferocity cast a wild, beastly twist to Sam’s face. Sam looked at Aspen. “You know this guy?” he asked."

    "text": "“Again, I am so terribly sorry for saying I wish you had died. You seem like a very pleasant person,” Aspen said desperately, feeling awful over how that whole situation just went. She, Adonis, and Sam all walked at the front of everyone, but Prince had joined them as well. Prince laughed. “It’s fine! I thought it was pretty funny, actually,” he reassured her. Aspen asked him about his daughters, and he happily chatted to her all about them as they followed the steep incline of the concrete to the manor. While they talked, Adonis gently nudged Sam’s arm. He pulled the gun out from his sweatshirt pocket and, after double checking the safety, twirled it around his finger. “Sorry. I didn’t mean to embarrass you in front of everyone. I was nervous about you using it on Carter when you were so close to Aspen.” Sam smiled lightly. “It’s fine, Adonis. You were one-hundred percent right about taking it from me. I was so frustrated, and although I really didn’t want to shoot, I’m not sure if I had complete control of myself. Thank you.” “Of course, Sammy. I just want you to know I’m sorry for embarrassing you if I did, and that I do trust you with a gun. Well, most of the time, anyway. We’re cool?” “We’re cool, Adonis. As long as you don’t call me Sammy,” he joked. He didn’t actually mind that much. Adonis passed the gun back to him, but Sam just passed it to the agent behind him. He didn’t actually want the gun either. “Sorry, this is random, but are you guys dating?” Prince asked over Aspen. Sam and Adonis immediately cracked up, hollering so loudly Aspen was nervous the whole valley could hear them. Sam composed himself first. “N-no, we’re not dating. I’m actually aromantic, so I’m just not really interested in dating anyways.” “Although, and I have told Sammy this before, the first time I talked to him may have been because I thought he was cute,” Adonis slyly admitted. Aspen glanced away from Adonis’ eyes for a fraction of a second. Adonis noticed and joked, “Don’t worry, Aspen. I’m bisexual.” Aspen stuck out her tongue as Prince hooted. They crested the steep hill and ended up in the chamber where the first grate, where this adventure had begun, hovered high above their heads, embedded in the concrete, laced with swirling vines creeping all over the rusty bars. The group paused for everyone to file into the room, and the room echoed quietly with labored breathing as the four who were left behind caught up after running the whole way. The concrete in this junction was much drier than the tunnels they had started in, and it was much drier than it had been a few days ago. Since it was near the top of the mountain, the only water left in it came from the only other tunnel connected to it, which kept going up the hill. All of the water from there drained through here, but only the tiniest creek wriggled through the middle of the concrete floor, wending through the center of a path carved from many other rainy seasons. Its track dipped slightly and was gently worn into the stone, permanently stained a light brown from years of stagnant water sitting during the dry seasons. The tiny creek was illuminated by the wavery late-afternoon sunbeams gilding the grate; the orange light threw itself against the walls and made every small drop of water that dripped from the delicate leaves of ivy poking through glow golden. The grey, dank concrete box lost its angular edges and hard construction, seeming magical and ethereal, full of life and possibility and wonder. This is beautiful, Adonis thought. His chest ached with the simplistic gorgeousness of soft sunbeams. He yearned to run away, run away from his problems and life, to where he didn’t know and didn’t care, just yearning to feel free. He thought, It’s amazing how different this cavern looks in sordid nighttime lighting versus this gold heaven spilling in. Aspen clapped her hands twice to bring attention to herself, and she climbed up the first two rungs of the ladder to raise herself above everyone. She wove herself around the bars, sitting on the second one, and resting her arms on the third. The sun just barely adorned her blonde hair, casting a goddess’ glow around her. Adonis leaned against one side of the ladder and Sam on the other. “This isn’t our final stopping place. We are going to continue through the other portal,” she pointed to the uphill branch, “and at the top of that, we are going to get out. I stopped us here because I think this will be the last place I can give out directions. Just as a few final reminders: I am going to the manor alone. You all are going to free the children; that is your first, primary, most important priority. Keep in mind that they are children; they are going to probably panic and be afraid, but try to reassure them as much as possible. Once you take the camp, Adonis and Sam are going to split off and follow me, as well as fifteen of you they have already selected to control the perimeter. The rest of you are going to come back with the kids; you didn’t have a leader before, but I think I’m going to give you one,” she paused and looked at each of their eyes, patient, loyal, intelligent eyes. “Prince, you’re not helping in the perimeter, right? Good. You will lead them.” Prince nodded. “You will split off again, and work your way to the seven different pickup sites. Make sure all the children fit in the cars. Pack them in, have them lay or sit on top of each other, whatever is necessary to fit all of them in. That is going to be the hardest part, but try to be as patient yet firm as you can. If you yourself cannot fit in the car, come back through the storm drains and try to help with the perimeter. Got it?” The unanimous voice of the forty-odd agents rumbled, “Yes, Mrs. Aspen.” “One more thing. No killing. At all costs, we are not trying to get ourselves arrested; even if it is self defense, we don’t want to take chances. Please try to disable your opponents, and remember that the majority of them are only working because they are scared and they have to. Some of them are extremely young as well. I’m not sure how young, as Odin kept me in the dark as well, but I am suspecting the youngest came straight from the camps.” Her words hung heavy over their heads. They resonated confusion and hurt. Even she, wife to this dictator, had no idea what was really going on. “Right, let’s keep going.” Aspen pulled her legs from between the rungs and swung from the ladder, catching herself with Adonis’ and Sam’s extended hands. They jogged to the front of the group and kept leading.\nNight was slowly blending with the day, stealing the meager warmth the sun provided. The sky burnished poppy-orange, melding with rosy hues at the western horizon, melting into indigo in the east, dotted with amethyst clouds. Sam, Adonis and Aspen stood at the edge of a cliff, partially concealed behind a towering pine, watching the sun fall away. The last of the agents hauled themselves out of the drain, leaving the gaping entrance open but hiding it with bits of branches. They assembled behind the trio, giving them an appropriate space. They assumed Adonis and Sam and Aspen were making final preparations and saying difficult goodbyes, and wanted to allow them proper respect and time for their plans.\n“That cloud looks like a butt,” Aspen said, pointing it out with her finger.\nAdonis and Sam giggled quietly. “That one looks really ugly,” Sam said. He blinked and shaded his eyes with one hand, then dramatically dropped his hand and shook his head. “Now that I look closer, I realise it just looks like Adonis. My bad.” \nAspen cackled as Adonis punched Sam. Aspen paused, then asked, “I’ll see you guys on the other side?” “You better believe it. And if I die, my soul will come back to haunt you,” Adonis said. “Ha ha, very funny.” She turned around and pulled them into a hug. “See you later.” “No goodbye?” Sam asked as she started walking down the hill. She paused and responded, “No. I never say goodbyes. They seem too permanent, too lasting.” “See you later, Aspen,” Sam said. Adonis waved. They watched her climb a few feet down the hill. Then they turned the other way and saw the whole camp laid out before them: a teeming collection of kids thrown in a landscape of tents, snow and small fires. Sam cracked his neck. “Let’s go, Adonis.”"

    "text": "The pot Odin had destroyed and left behind had geraniums hand-planted in it by Aspen. As the plant’s roots were left exposed to the air, the small flowers withered, curling drily at their edges and turning from a cheery magenta-pink to brown.\n\nAspen trotted down the hill, tucking her hands into her armpits to try to warm them. She needed her fingers to be nimble. She followed almost the same route she had before, when she first found her garden razed, except she wound around the back of the house. She didn’t want to use the main path in case Odin had started slapping guards on the paths around the house. Briarcliff Valley was far north, in Montana, tucked away from Helena and the other cities. Therefore, since it was winter, the sun would fall faster each day until the twenty-first. It was only four in the afternoon, but already the sun was retiring. At least the darkness will help cover me, Aspen thought. The help is welcome, but I have to admit that I’ve gotten rather good at sneaking around my own house. She dodged underneath the trees’ boughs and between their trunks until she reached the bottom of the hill and the house came into view, just a hundred feet away. She was at the back of it again, and looking from its left to its right, she could see the popularly-used laundry room, the curve of the tower library, the glass cap of the great foyer, and finally the kitchen after a long blank space. The laundry room before had only been protected with the single security camera; now Aspen picked out two others subtly hidden near the door. The only other possible way she could think to get in was through the kitchen’s windows, but they were seven feet off the ground, and if she managed to get that high, she wasn’t sure if she would be able to fit through the gap that was only one foot tall and two feet wide. But what other choice do I have? There’s no way I can go through the laundry room anymore, I think trying to enter through the front is too risky… She thought about it for as long as she dared, but couldn’t think of any other way. I guess I’m small, I should be fine. Wait, do these even open? Am I going to have to smash it? She shook off her worries, bounced lightly on her toes, and wiggled her fingertips. Relax. It’s all over soon. Breathe in. I just need to get to Jeff’s office and talk to him. I just need to stall. Exhale slowly. Now! She leaped from her spot in the trees and sprinted across the land, feeling the little crunches of an ice layer snapping. Up, how do I get up? She only needed a foot, maybe foot-and-a-half boost; she could jump up the rest of the way. She slid her sprint to a stop and lunged as she saw the tacky fake rock the gardeners used to cover up the sprinkler timers. It was hollow, light, and hopefully durable enough to hold her weight for a mere moment. Crouching low to balance, she hoisted the cover in her right hand and chucked it in front of her, letting it freely slide across the pavement and then bonk into the wall, skittering slightly. That’s fine. Close enough. She scrutinized the windows again, surmised she was going to have to smash the glass to get in, and plucked a big, real, rock from right beside the sprinkler timers. She sidled a bit closer to the windows, picked one, and threw the rock as hard as she could into it. It immediately shattered and Aspen winced at the loud crashing and cringed at every crystally tinkle the pieces made as they littered the pavement and, Aspen assumed, the entire kitchen. The rock landed inside densely, coming to rest on the lip of a counter after slamming into a few pots and sliding around. The glass broke peculiarly. Curious, Aspen bent to pick up a piece and had to resist cheering when she saw its shape; the piece she pinched between her fingers, along with all the other pieces, were in various-shaped chunks, but all were smooth on the faces and had rounded corners. The window is tempered glass. This is going to be so much easier. The chances of slicing her back and thighs open on tempered glass was much lower than the typical kind of heat glass she had expected. She brushed glass pieces out of her way with her gloved palm and froze as she heard an exclamation from inside. She fell back onto her palms and craned her neck, attempting to peer through the windows, and scrambled to lie flat against the wall as someone’s curly afro peeked out. “Is anyone there? C-can I help you?” the woman inside asked uncertainly, not sure how to respond to a shattered window. She clearly had not spotted Aspen yet. No! I thought everyone was supposed to be looking for me outside of the house! Aspen grumped, angry that she had been found out again while trying to sneak into her own house. Sadly she thought, I always get caught right before I actually make it in. Praying that whoever was at the window did not exude the same sickening, slimy confidence that Carter had in the storm drains, Aspen asked if she had any genuine allegiance to Odin. The woman at the window started, still not seeing Aspen pressed against the wall, then quietly said no, she did not like Odin one bit. “Then I am your friend, here to help you.” Aspen rolled to standing and stepped back slightly from the wall to look at the window woman. “Do you work at the house? I don’t think I’ve seen you before.” The woman nodded, her curls bouncing lightly. “Yes. I’m Odin’s secretary. I don’t know many people here because I’m pretty new and also because Odin doesn’t leave me a lot of free time. I’m Cassie.” Cassie waited a polite beat for Aspen’s name, and Aspen was a bit shocked that Cassie didn’t recognize her. I guess Odin really didn’t want me to meet her. Maybe she has some information he doesn’t want me to hear. When Aspen didn’t give her name, Cassie just moved on. “Would you like some help?” Cassie asked, reaching out her left arm and leaning over the edge. She pulled off her glasses with her other hand so they wouldn’t fall. Their large square rims were purple, her favorite color. “I’m guessing you’re trying to break in?” Aspen grinned sheepishly, pushed the fake rock into place, and accepted Cassie’s arm, hauling herself through the small window. She asked, “Do you know if Odin is here?” Cassie shook her head. “No, he’s gone. He just left a moment ago to look for his wife.” “Is anyone here besides you?” Aspen asked as she straightened from the floor. “Not that I know of,” Cassie said, walking ahead of Aspen and pushing the kitchen door open for her. “Where do you want to go?” “I need to go to Je-” Aspen cleared her throat. “Odin’s office.” They walked quickly through the hall, an awkward silence resting between them. Trying to start a conversation, Cassie asked, “So how are you going to take down Mr. Odin?” Aspen, who still hadn’t provided her name or any personal information, started explaining the outline of the plan to Cassie. Cassie didn’t believe her fantastical plan at first, but when Aspen told her about breaking out the children, Cassie became ecstatic. She thought happily, Finally, someone is taking responsibility for them. As Aspen and Cassie walked through the foyer, Aspen cut herself off as she saw the destroyed plant pot. “Ah! What happened here?” she asked, dropping next to it and scooping up some of the bigger pieces. “Right before he left, he threw the pot across the room. I think he was throwing it at someone because he was screaming before that, but I’m not sure. I was heading to the kitchen to have dinner, but then you smashed the window,” Cassie said sorrowfully. “Lucky your rock didn’t hit me, huh?” Aspen didn’t respond for a moment. She was kneeling on the ground, soiling the knees of her pants with the dirt. Her back curved and she was weary, holding what felt like the weight of the universe on her back. Defeated. I feel defeated. She struggled to talk past the lump in her throat. “Yeah… I’m sorry. I didn’t know you were there.” Cassie hesitantly asked, “Is there something on the pot? Or can we keep moving?” “I painted this as a part of a set for him. For our anniversary.”\n“You’re his wife.” Cassie didn’t really ask. “Why didn’t you tell me?” “I have known him for years. I have been married to him for years. Somehow, he’s a stranger to me.” Aspen spoke haltingly, and still hadn’t moved from the ground. Out of all the things he had done to her, this smashed pot hurt the most. She had painted swirling koi, her favorite animal, playing with white cats, his favorite animal. She had painted three pots in total, each taking a month to design, sketch, paint and glaze. A shard with a cat’s green eye looked up at her, seeming to laugh at her misery. Another piece with a spotted koi swam towards her. “I didn’t tell you because I thought he might do something to you if you knew but didn’t tell him. I don’t know. I’m sorry.” Cassie was silent for a moment. She yelled in disbelief, “What do you mean you don’t know what he would do? He would do exactly what he always does!” Aspen was startled by the rage in her voice. Aspen looked over her shoulder, but fell back onto her hands as Cassie stepped closer. Her palms were sliced by the broken pottery. “Pull your head out of the clouds! Join us back on earth! You probably think life is peachy, and how tragic it is that the worst thing Odin could do is smash a pot! Where is your awareness?” Cassie was easily 5’8” and had lean muscles all over her body. She bent over and effortlessly scooped Aspen off the ground by the collar of her jacket. Aspen panicked for a second, but stilled when she saw that Cassie’s eyes were burning with tears, not hatred. “Cassie, I have no idea what Odin does. He shielded me on purpose, but believe me, I am not naive,” Aspen said slowly. “I was abused by him. I’ve seen his sick collection of children. I saw Sam walking through the halls on Thanksgiving, covered in blood and seizing. I don’t know how it happened. You have to believe me, I am here to help you! I am not your enemy, but right now, we are wasting precious time, time I need.” Cassie wasn’t moved by her plea for time. Sighing, Aspen asked, “It seems like this can’t wait till later; what did he do to you?” “All I did was barge into his office inopportunely. I served him every day, catered to his every need, and one day I barged into his room shortly after he told me he would not tolerate interruptions.” Cassie’s arms shook. She still had Aspen’s collar curled in her fist. “He captured my mother, father and brother who all lived in the valley. He wanted to test a new concoction he had just invented, with deadly amounts of medicinal and recreational drugs, causing hallucinations, internal bleeding, and countless physical ailments. My interruption was convenient timing, and it gave him three good test subjects. “What’s your name?” Cassie asked Aspen. “Aspen,” she answered quietly. “Aspen, there are people dying in your basement. I had to watch my mom, dad and brother die because of your husband.” Cassie was glaring at Aspen, but they both knew the anger wasn’t for Aspen. Unfortunately, Aspen was the only outlet Cassie had to let out her fury. She finally lowered Aspen to the floor and waited for her to respond. Aspen stared at the floor. Cassie couldn’t see her face, but after a while, her shoulders started shaking and she covered her face with her hands, smearing blood all over her skin, tangling her fingers in her hair roots. Cassie felt guilt wrench her stomach. She really didn’t know. Aspen screamed, “I’m sorry! I had no idea, I’m so sorry!” Tears poured through the slits in between her fingers. “God, I’m so embarrassed! You’re right! I had no idea! I had no idea I married the-the damned devil! Agh!” She slid to the ground and banged her right fist against the tile, bruising the edge of her hand. Her fist left a partial blood print on the marble. Her hair, already soiled from the gutter water, was now matted with clots of her own blood. Maroon spots expanded on her pants, growing with each drip, mixing with drops of her tears. She tore her hands away from her deranged face and looked up at Cassie. “I’M SORRY I MARRIED A MURDERER!” Aspen’s chest heaved and Cassie’s cheeks burned. Cassie didn’t have a response. Aspen stood again and poked a finger into Cassie’s chest, forcing her to walk backwards. “And don’t you dare tell me none of this is my fault! I needed to hear that months ago, when I had no support from anyone. I helped everyone I can, but I’m no god! I’m fallible, I’m not perfect, but I have nothing else to give, and for the longest damn time, I had no one else to give me anything. I am tired Cassie, I’m tired of being treated like a child by every single person, yet I’m expected to comfort everyone like their damned therapist when they aren’t okay! No one gave a horses’ ass about me in the years I was forced to live here, nor in the years before! So just-” Aspen dropped her hands and screamed with her mouth closed, frustrated at everything. Blink. A mask of practiced calm snapped over her features. Her voice fractured but she continued: “I need to go to Odin’s office. Follow me if you want. I’m sorry for what happened to your family, as well as countless others, but I’m trying to fix it. Sorry.” She whipped around and stomped to the staircase, kicking the chunks of pottery out of her way. Aspen had climbed up the levels and was walking on the balcony when Cassie called, “Wait. Aspen. I want to help.” Cassie had been tailing behind her and was at the stairwell, waiting for Aspen to signal for her to proceed. Aspen turned around and jerked her head, allowing Cassie to walk with her. “What do you need me to do?” Aspen pushed away the sickening sensation that crawled on her skin when she looked at Cassie, composing herself. Despite what had just happened, she needed to keep moving forward with the plan, and if Cassie was offering help, she was going to take it. “I want to confront Odin in a place where I have the advantage. Basically, I just want to talk with him; I’m pretty sure he wants me back, and that I’m probably the only person he’ll listen to. So, I’m going to his office because it’s tucked in the back, and I know if I need to get out, I can jump from his window to the ledge below. Later, there are going to be more agents coming; two of them, the leaders, you will tell to come here. For now, I want you to clean up the pottery downstairs and if you see Odin, tell him I’m waiting in the office.” “How will I know which two are the leaders?” Cassie asked. They had reached the imposing double doors of Odin’s office. A slight smile spread on Aspen’s face. “Don’t worry. They’ll stand out.” After a pause she said, “After you find them, I would suggest you run and hide in case this doesn’t work.” Aspen started to close the door as she walked in, but Cassie grabbed the edge of it. “Can I open up the basement instead?” Aspen stopped and looked Cassie up-and-down. “You’re digging your own grave.” “I think you’re already standing thigh-deep in yours,” Cassie responded. “I think I like you,” Aspen grinned. “I hope I see you again after.” “And you as well,” Cassie said. She reached out her hand to Aspen and they shook. Cassie pulled the door closed the rest of the way. Aspen fisted her hands and placed them on her hips, breathed the deep, woody air into her lungs. She doubled over and coughed violently as the pungent scent of wine cut her throat. Disgusting. She walked to Odin’s desk and plucked the opened, half-drunk bottle of white wine by its neck and threw it into the fireplace. The weak coals leftover from an old fire crackled feebly, sputtering weak protests at the glass bottle as it covered their flames. She threw another log from the basket on the fire and relit it from Odin’s tinderbox. She stood frozen at the fire’s edge, her vision glazing over as the golden flames licked and played in the air. Now I wait. She drifted around the room for a bit, scuffing the dark stains on the floor that she knew was her blood with the toe of her shoe, leisurely dragging her finger across the spines of books on the shelf. Her hands were still bleeding from Cassie forcing her back into the pottery, so Aspen grabbed a pair of scissors from Odin’s desk and cut two pieces of the curtains off. The plastic handles slipped in her hands, slick from the blood, but she just gripped them harder. The pressure pushed a few smaller shards deeper into her tender skin and made her hands throb. I’ll have to get the pieces out later. Right now, not fainting from blood loss is more important, she thought as she used her teeth to cinch the knots in the curtain tightly. She plopped back in his chair and tossed the scissors back on the table, staring through the fireplace bricks. She closed her eyes and her head fell back as she released a pent-up breath. She had no idea how long she was going to have to wait, but the tension was killing her, and night had fallen. While the mission had felt dangerous before (despite the sun’s lightness egging them onwards), it now felt eerie, mysterious in it’s silky nighttime shroud. With her eyes still closed, she splayed over the chair, firmly planting both her forearms on the armrests. Cassie must have exaggerated right? Despite everything, some part of her couldn’t quite accept that part of Jeff. I know he hid things, but I’ve been to the basement many times in the past year. One basement. Odin manor had two; how could she have forgotten? But that doesn’t make sense. Sam and Adonis came from a basement, but they told me it was unfinished. The basement I’m thinking of is finished with a movie theatre. Odin didn’t throw them in this ‘other’ basement, right? Aspen puzzled over it until her head started to hurt. I know every staff member, I think, but I’ve never even seen Cassie…she has something I’m not supposed to know. Aspen pushed out of the chair and tiptoed to the doors. Even though she knew no one was home, she still felt paranoid enough to sneak around. After listening through the crack between the doors, she eased one open and looked around the hall. To the right, there was a desk and when she got closer, she saw a small sign with Cassie’s name on it. She walked around the desk and shuffled through the papers on the top. Her fingers were stiff from the curtain bandages, and she had tied them so tightly her fingertips did not have enough blood circulation; they were a pale-yellowish color. She wasn’t sure what she was looking for in the papers, but she was hoping to find something, anything that could explain some part of her life for the past three years. The overhead lights were off, so she put the small flashlight back in her mouth and started digging through the drawers. Slowly, as she mindlessly sifted through papers and knicknacks, her chest got heavier and it was hard to breathe as memories trickled in. She remembered moving to Odin manor, how she and Jeff redid the interior to fit both their tastes, how Jeff and she laughed and joked so often in the first year. She remembered the days she and Jeff had where they walked the forest together, pausing often so she could draw or point something out. She remembered the time Jeff went shopping with her in the valley and helped her pick out a dress, even modeling the dress himself to ‘see if it looked good on him.’ She was so happy it hurt. What went wrong? How could I allow this to happen? These two questions had been churning in her for months now, at first just about her and how she managed to get locked inside her own home, but then about Sam and Adonis and the workers and the children and the plots. When did everything change? Jeff had always felt like an outcast in school, being a transfer kid from a new country forced to live with his extended family. He had felt misunderstood, sure, but he was never violent. Aspen dug through more papers, now barely scanning the titles, feeling like her chest pressed deeper inward the longer she sat like this with her turbulent mind. When was the first time he slapped me? That question shocked her, releasing the pressure in her chest. She stopped searching momentarily, but went back to her mindless work. Forcing herself to relive these horrible memories hurt just as much as the happy ones had, but she knew that she needed to figure this out for herself. She had to reassure herself that there was nothing she could’ve done to stop all of this. She had to reassure herself that she definitely, undoubtedly, had played no part in his violence at all. She tried to remember when the first time was that she felt the sting of Jeff’s hand on her face, but one memory demanded precedence. Hot, yet breezy day. March 28, 2017. Aspen was digging in the forest, searching for native flora and sketching them. She was outlining the yellow petals of a Salsify when she heard rustling through the underbrush nearby. She feared a bear was lumbering about, but the afternoon was so calm, with golden-syrup beams pouring through the trees’ branches and birds chirping, that she presumed it was probably a bunny. She started, dropping her pencil in the loam, when Jeff’s shadow covered her as he walked around a tree. He was clearly upset, so she asked him what was wrong. “My grandpa just died, and instead of having a funeral, my family is celebrating my brother being accepted onto the olympic team,” he had said hollowly. Jeff had inherited this manor early, before his grandfather died, so that his grandfather could move back to Europe and be taken care of by Jeff’s parents. Jeff had inherited the manor instead of his other two, older, more accomplished, brothers, so his grandpa had clearly favored Jeff over them for whatever reason. “Oh, oh no, Jeff, I’m so sorry,” Aspen had said, standing and wrapping her arms around his middle. In a shaky voice he had lamented, “They couldn’t care less about him. My parents only care about my stupid brothers. Apparently, he passed almost a week ago, and they forgot to tell me until now. Why can’t they just care about me? It’s like I don’t exist. I am a clump of mold that got attached to their rotting trunk and I can’t get off.” Aspen felt his eyes watering and spilling onto her. “No, Jeff. Do not say that, ever. You are special and unique. Everyone has special talents, and sometimes families aren’t present to support them. It’s okay to be separated from your family, it’s okay if you have talents they don’t appreciate, because the only person that needs to realize how unique and amazing you are is you. You can trust I’ll always be at your side for you because I need you, I love you.” Aspen was jerked back to reality when she stumbled into the last drawer, which refused to open. It didn’t appear to have a lock, but when she tugged on it, it stubbornly refused to move. She slid from the desk chair to the floor and dug her fingers underneath the lip of the drawer, feeling around for something on the rails that might have stopped the drawer. Feeling nothing she took her hand back, dejected. The important papers I want are definitely inside here. She glared at the metal and reached under again, feeling for a latch or button. Frustrated, she simply slapped her hand against the bottom and jumped in surprise when something heavy fell into her palm. She dragged it out and found she was holding the entire drawer, minus the front of it, in her hand. Clever. The front of it was fake. She placed the drawer-box next to her and momentarily took the flashlight out of her mouth. Her jaw was getting sore from holding it so long, so she transferred it to one hand and started digging through the random papers inside the drawer, hoping that something exciting would surface; if nothing did, she would probably have to concede and just continue waiting for Odin in the office. She reached the bottom of the stack and still nothing had caught her eyes. It was all just taxes, or bills, or information sheets on the townspeople or workers. She left the papers on the floor and flipped the box over, looking for another secret compartment. When she flipped it, a very thin folder slid out from a slit in the side. She held the flashlight up to it and saw that it said:\nRESTRICTED\nDO NOT READ. DO NOT REMOVE FROM DRAWER. DO NOT CREATE COPIES UNLESS INSTRUCTED.\nAspen sat in awe for a moment. I’m definitely not supposed to see this! she thought excitedly, and tore open the cover. There were many sheets of paper with long blocks of text in small font; she closed the cover and returned to Odin’s office. She left Cassie’s desk messy because she just didn’t care if Odin found it anymore.\nThe moonlight glowed through the windows and she angled herself so she could read without the flashlight. The more she read, she felt her stomach drop. It hit her just how much Odin had lied and deceived her, even when she had concluded he hadn’t been that bad yet. \nThe folder was like a deconstructed journal, with receipts and thoughts and random scribbling. The pages weren’t in the proper order as she read the entries and she skipped from month to month. This is a lunatic’s compendium of random ideas. I’ve been married to a maniac, Aspen thought feverishly before diving in with a head-first attitude. \n\nJanuary 1, 2018: $3,000 donated BP. \nFebruary 6, 2019: Supplier delivered 3.5 kg acetaminophen, 1.0 kg melatonin.

July 21, 2018: First group of house staff briefed and added. Aspen introduced. Lady was not made aware as to where they came from. -Jordan\nShe found more and more receipts piled on top of each other, but they all were for the same things: innumerable child-sized scarves and socks, painkillers, antidepressants, alcohol, cameras. Notes, staff lists, thumbnail sketches of–what? Aspen found that ‘Jordan’ and ‘Cassie’ and ‘Elizabeth’ were just another two names lost in the long list of people Aspen had never heard of but supposedly worked in and around her house. And the strangest of all: where on earth were these enormous sums of money going? As far as Aspen knew, Odin had not binge-bought any items close to those numerical values. Could he have paid people off? Aspen hissed out a breath. No, no, that’s stupid. I think. But the abbreviation… Two pieces of paper were left. Aspen’s heart beat as she knew time had passed, how much she wasn’t sure, but enough for it to be dangerous to keep reading. Odin could burst through his office doors at any moment now. She sucked in a deep, rattling breath and shifted her shoulders to let more light bleed across the papers; these text blocks were longer than the others.\nJuly 9, 2018: Aspen and I took a walk through the forest today, and we came across a beautiful clearing in a small valley. It really was nothing more than a small dip in the land with waist-high swaying grass, but she immediately envisioned a garden and helped me imagine her vision for it along with her. She and I are now planning to plant rows of non-invasive native flowers, and she wants to take a stone carving class so she can learn how to carve a dragon centerpiece. I am excited to help her on her project :)\nMay 14, 2019: Order pushed to all house members: Lady of the House, Miss Aspen-Fauna, is to be left out of all meetings with staff. Lady is to be protected at all costs, all her wants and needs are expected to be met instantly. Do not disturb the Lady as she has dealt with much; you are not to include her in any meetings nor give her any information.\nShe thought she had reached the end of the stack, which she was grateful for. These last two entries about her hurt. A lot. But the very last entry, hastily scribbled on the inside of the paper folder, that she spotted only after she squinted right at the yellowed folder, broke her.\nMarch 27, 2018: Grandfather has passed. My family does not care, but Aspen has been amazing. She promised to always be by my side, and she made me my favorite spaghetti dinner. I’ve realized that my family always hurts me, even if it is by accident, so I’ve decided I’m going to let them go. I don’t resent them; no, I forgive them, but I also am learning how to protect myself. How to put up walls, one would say. Protection. It’s also made me realize how I want to protect Aspen, forever. The sour side of me is happy that she doesn’t have a family. I’m sure that if she did know her biological family, they would be lovely people, yet any parents can inflict damage on their children. Perhaps it’s just better for a child to have no parents at all. They still need rules and values to shape them, but they certainly don’t need to worry about being yelled at, or being a failure, or even worrying about whether their parents are going to divorce, whether their parents even actually love each other. I’ve fought with that idea forever. My parents, I thought they loved each other, but I had to let go of that after seeing so much drunken yelling. I don’t think that’s what love looks like, and I’m sad that’s all I’ve learned from them. Why do I even bother hoping they’re in love? It won’t affect me either way, and I’m just putting faith in a crumbling bridge. The most insulting thing is when they would say something rude to me and apologize by just saying they love me. Or they would say “we’re human, we make mistakes.” Am I a mistake, then? Maybe I’m humanity’s mistake. This is exhausting for me to think and write about. Families are exhausting. Maybe I just need to go to bed and sleep for a long, long time. An eternity; long enough to forget who my parents are and what they’ve done to me.\nAspen’s hands shook. This explained everything, even more than she had even come looking for. It was all right here, all along. His demented explaination for the children. His secrets. Him. Her. Him and her. She slapped the papers back into a stack and hurled it at the far wall. Small slips fluttered off the stack as it flew, but the main clump hit the wall’s paint with a smack. Her hands curled into her hair and she hunched her torso over her legs. Pressure built in her throat, burning, her head, throbbing, behind her eyes, dripping, everything was blurry and the silence pressed in so loudly and she felt like clawing her face off- Cold air suddenly stung her, shakily filling her lungs like the crack of a whip on her back. Carefully pulling her hands away from her head, she opened and closed her fists, flexed her palms. She looked around the room, his room, again. There was a chip in her eyes that wasn’t there before. A chip with a razor-sharp paper-thin edge, like the shards of her broken pottery in the foyer. This chip could slice through the physical flesh of men and the figurative thoughts in her mind alike, of which it did; she felt her hurt feelings rip then drain away as if they had never existed at all. They all were pushed to the recesses of her mind: betrayal, anger, sadness, confusion, all compacted into a burning coal that simmered underneath a stiff layer of nothing. She felt nothing. Nothing at all. She stood from the overstuffed chair, the worn leather and downy feathers springing back to their fullness. Aspen reached her right arm high in the air, grabbed her elbow with her left hand, and leaned to the side, cracking her back. She twisted her neck around and rolled her shoulders, wishing she could roll back, roll away, Odin (or is he Jefferson?) from her mind. She stared hollowly through the far-away doors. I love him. No, I loved him. But he still loves me. He thinks this is what love is like, she thought distantly. I think he knows this is bad. I hate this. I hate that I still want to find the good in him. He doesn’t deserve another chance. But this is all he knows! How was he supposed to learn basic morals when his parents had no desire to teach him? Aspen looked away from the door, instead finding her eyes to be attracted to the sword on the wall. He isn’t a good person. He isn’t a good person. He is demented and twisted and sick and needs hella therapy. He isn’t a good person. He isn’t a good person! He isn’t a good person! Aspen walked around the desk, up to the fireplace, and wrapped her hand around the hilt, painfully squishing the bandages against her tender skin. The sword was heavy, jerking her hand to the ground when she fumbled it off its hooks. She righted herself and stalked back to Odin’s chair, scarring a thin groove in the wooden floor by lazily dragging the sword tip across it. Crossing one leg over the other, she balanced the blade across her thighs and once again stared at the office’s doors, her stare so intensely lethal that the scars indented from long-ago fights seemed to shirk away from it."

    "text": "↞⇼↠\nCrunch. Crunch. Crunch. Crunch. Swoosh-slsh-psh-slidsh. The regular, repetitive crunch of Adonis’ boot stepping on layers of ice and leaves and crispy dirt stopped as he startled, slipped, began falling, but roughly caught himself by clutching onto a jagged tree trunk. His eyes, mostly closed as a result of his lingering exhaustion, snapped open and widened dramatically. His pupils shrunk as he really saw what startled him. His nose tip trembled. \n“...Sam?” Adonis cleared his throat. “Sam! Get over here!” he whisper-yelled, unable to tear his eyes from the mound in the dirty snow that had caught his attention. He looked away, biting back his revulsion, and slowly released the tree.\nThe mission technically had not even started yet. Right now, Sam and Adonis’ team was spread out around the valley, ringing its edge. They were just barely concealed by the foliage and readying their gear and prepping last-minute things, all waiting for the start signal to descend onto the children. Adonis, of course, had to pee. He had crept a short distance into the forest, finished his business, and was coming back when a strange smell made him divert his path. He supposed there was a decaying deer or bear somewhere near and wanted to check it out. He truly had no desire to see it as he was pretty squeamish, but he thought it would be better to find it now and deal with it than have a small kid find it later and totally freak out. \nHe had carefully stepped around, wasting precious minutes to find the decomposing creature, straining to see in the dark without his flashlight. He found it, the thing-creature, and that’s when he slid, trying to avoid the thing on the ground, and called Sam. \nSam huffed as he saw Adonis standing awkwardly away from a tree, holding his arms tightly to himself. “What? You got scared of your own peeing sounds or something?” Sam dramatically flicked on his flashlight and dropped his vexed air now that he could actually see the terror suffusing features of Adonis’ face. He skipped to Adonis and caught his bicep, looking into him to try to see what was bothering Adonis so. “Hey, what is it? What’s wrong?” \nAdonis jerkily pointed his thumb to the mass behind him. Sam’s lips pressed into a hard, unflinching line, not able to comprehend it yet. He cautiously stepped around Adonis, protectively putting himself in front of his rattled friend, and stared at it. The back of Sam’s eyes felt hot and his face hardened. \nThe guard’s uniform was tattered. Shredded, but identifiable. \n“How long do you think they’ve been dead?”"

    "text": "As much experience as Adonis and Sam and everyone here had collected in their careers, they were not masterminds. They were not gods, nor superheros, nor could they turn invisible, nor did they not make sound when they stepped, all of which could have been extremely useful in the recent past. This ‘quick trip’ to the mountains was meant to be just that: uncomplicated, simple, likely just a rumor, and having to arrest someone for making the ‘bomb threat’ was implausible. Yet here they were, being told that saving this perfectly-ravaged town was left up to them. Briarcliff: a town with so many finely twisted tenebrous threads twined in between Odin’s fingers that it was laughably unrealistic that two mediocrely-prepped, early-twenties dudes should have to shoulder it all. And yet. Here. They. Were. Caught in it all. Caught in one hell of a tangled web. Caught, pulled, twisted, all between people they had barely met. Surface-level knowledge was all they had of the kid in front of them, but Sam could barely hold back his bile, and Adonis struggled to hold in his tears. They could not be undone now, not when everything was so close to working. Not when the agents were faithfully waiting for the ‘go.’ Not when the flock of Briarcliff’s children huddled in the field, shorn of their innocence, waiting for salvation while shivering in too-thin coats. Not now. Not now. Just keep it together, alright? We’ll be okay, Sam tells Adonis. Adonis nods. You’re right. Let’s go. We’ve got this. They’re tired. But if the wrong string were to break…\n“Agents in position?” three ‘yeses’ came back to Adonis through his walkie-talkie. Trinity, Selena, nor any of the agents hadn’t thought to specifically seek out and bring two-way radios for whatever reason, and Adonis had managed to find only five scattered in the vans. Francis, as the leader of the driving team, possessed one and set to channel three, Adonis and Sam shared one on channel one, and the last three were distributed to the group around the childrens’ valley, also on channel one. Channel two was in-between, designated in case agents in channel one wished to speak only to each other.\n“Prince, are you confident to lead after the children have been secured?” Sam leaned in and asked. “Yes, sir. I am prepared.” Prince became one of the radio-holders after Aspen made him the leader of the storm drain tunnels. “On my mark.” Adonis took back the radio. He stepped from the dappled-moonlight, created by the great pines’ feathery tips, into the crisp wash of bright moonlight. “Set.” He tied the top layer of his hair into a ponytail on his crown to keep it out of his face. His fingers brushed his cheeks, his mind betrayed him: he dared to wonder what the dead boy’s cheek felt like. Squinting, he steeled his mind and shook off the memory of his young, sunken face; nothing could be allowed to distract him from the alive children, the children who still depended on rescue from him. Sam and he were planning to return to the boy after tonight, learn his name and family, and give him a proper burial for his bravery and honor. “Now!” Agents without walkie-talkies watched those who did have them. On cue, they raised their hands and waved, jump-starting the group to walk down the hill and to the camp. Like ants returning to their hill, they crept down the mountainside towards the flickering bonfire centered in the ocean of tents. It seemed all the children were crowded around it, as well as the guards. The fire was the only source of light in the camp. The tents around the perimeter faded into darkness, and long ghastly shadows flickered ominously whenever someone in the middle moved.\nSam nodded to Adonis, who returned his nod, then split off and they lost sight of each other. Sam savored the crisp wind on his face, and took a deep breath of the air. The very clean air. Not air tainted with the thick-sweet smell of rotting- Focus, Sam told off his brain in a highly practiced way. Still, his brows drew together, the sunken face flashing in his mind too. Light and quick, he skipped between the boulders and tree trunks, trying to stay as quiet as possible. He was pretty sure all of the camp was gathered around the fire, but say, if a stick snapped at just the wrong second, he did not want a too-curious guard or child to trace the sound. It seemed that Aspen’s idea to get the children was going to be easier than they had anticipated. Her plan was to, with the least violence possible, immobilize each guard (however many there are) using their own handcuffs, and somehow clump the kids together and lead them away. Simple. Theoretically mess-free, but Sam knew that if it was really going to be this easy, someone would have done this before. After helping the agents and kids back to the entrance of the storm drain, he, Adonis, and the pre-selected agents would sprint to the manor and help Aspen. Nothing is ever as easy as that though, Sam thought, apprehensive. A grim thought dawned on him: Nobody can find that body. That would just be…too much. Finally, Sam reached the perimeter. He slowed and paused, his hands aloft and fisted, his front foot planted, his eyes sharp as he checked for safety around himself. A breeze stirred, rippling the canvas of a tent right in front of him. He caught eyes with Prince as he looked about, struggling to decipher it as Prince’s face in the hazy darkness. Nodding, Sam lowered his hands and resumed creeping towards the middle. Rustle. Sam whipped around. The sound didn’t seem like it had come from the right area to be Adonis, but: “Adonis? Adonis?” he whisper-called twice. Nothing. That means- He looked around again, certain it wasn’t an animal. He was right. The guard was already running, sprinting, raising a hand to her cheek, opening her mouth… Sam took off after her. He was determined to still be as silent as possible, as a scuffle right now would still attract too much attention. He alternated between watching the uneven ground fly beneath his feet and monitoring the guard’s progress as he gained on her. She cast one more look over her shoulder, flicking her head to the side, her long copper braid flying in a dramatic arc. Sam saw her draw in a sharp breath. No! “Help! I’m-” Sam barrelled into her, knocking her smaller frame to the ground with ease. He wrapped his left arm around her midsection to be a weak cushion between her and the ground, but he still cringed as they landed with a thump and he felt the air whoosh out of her. As a precaution, he covered her mouth with his right hand. Refusing to lose a fight, she fought her mouth open and bit down hard on Sam’s finger. He cursed and pulled his hand away, whipped his other arm out from under her, then drove his right elbow into the top of her back. Spluttering, she twisted and craned her neck to throw him a glare. Sam glowered back, and without taking his eyes off her as she fought to draw in a breath, wrested the handcuffs hanging from her hip. She sensed his hand pulling the cuffs free and bucked her hips to try to throw him off. He sighed, but didn’t move. “Get off me!” she hissed indignantly. Sam groaned dramatically and finally lifted his elbow from her back so she could breathe. “Look, I’m not against you. Unless you like Odin. Do you genuinely work for Odin?” “No, but I do like staying alive. We’re being watched, always,” she whispered back, jerking her chin at an unassuming tree growing a few yards away. Sam whipped around, searching the tree’s bark for something. He assumed she meant there was a camera hidden in it, but he didn’t immediately see the glint of a lens or the blink of a light, so he turned back to her and said, “Don’t worry about that anymore. It’s all being taken care of tonight.” “Great.” She sat for a moment more, mindlessly nudging a ridge of dirt with the toe of her boot. She looked back to Sam, who was watching her quietly. “Will you let me up now?” Sam jumped slightly. “Oh, yeah, sorry.” Yet he didn’t move. She gave a small shake of her head an expression that clearly said ‘what?’ “Promise you won’t take me down as soon as you get up?” “Pinky promise,” she said, rolling her eyes and holding up her pinky for extra theatrics. Sam hopped up and offered her his hand. “Sorry, I didn’t hurt you, did I?” “Eh, I’ll be fine. So what are you doing, exactly? Are you working alone?” A wave of high-pitched screams rolled across the valley. Sam groaned and ran an anxious hand through his hair. “Other than wasting time with you, I’m supposed to be helping with that.” He flung his hand towards the vague center. “Just follow me, ok-?” Her boot came out of nowhere. One second, Sam was facing the direction towards the center, the kids’ irregular screaming echoing in his ears, then he was facing the dirt with a high, piercing pitch ringing in his head when his skull collided with something hard. Sam rolled onto his back, squinting at her angrily and clutching his head, and debating whether he was annoyed with her attitude or impressed by her ferocious kick. Offering no explanation, she swiftly knelt next to Sam to grab the handcuffs from where they had fallen, murmuring something, and quickly righted herself. Sam guessed what she was thinking when another guard thundered around the corner. His hair was as distressed as his face was flustered. He quickly recovered and a cocky air overcame him. “Taylor! There you are!” his voice boomed. He spread his arms wide like he was expecting a hug from the female guard. Taylor, apparently, Sam told himself. “I was looking all over for you. You’re missing all the fun.” He pointed his thumb over his shoulder, towards the noisy mess that was the center of the camp. Sam itched to get up and ditch Taylor with this dude, to help his coworkers like he should be. But something fluttered in his chest, urging him to wait for this to play out. Sam couldn’t read people like Adonis, but something went wrong with Taylor when this guy had come out of nowhere. Taylor rose on her toes and looked over his shoulder innocently. “It looks to me like you’re running away from all the ‘fun,’” she sweetly replied. He blustered for a moment, but quickly recovered by gesturing at Sam and laughing heartily. “And what’s this, Tay-Tay?” Sam worked his jaw, still puzzling. “I caught him,” she answered. Breezily. Confidently. The guard laughed again, a little too loudly. “Hah! Oh come on, really? You actually took him down?” He scoffed, “Come on, there’s no way you think I’m gonna believe that. A little thing like you, taking down a big guy like that.” He directed his next words to Sam, who was starting to feel revulsion closing up his throat. “You just gave in because of her pretty face, didn’t you? Well, hey man, no shame, no shame-” “Taylor?” Sam blatantly cut off the guard and turned back to her. There. The smallest tremor passed through her hand. Hm. “How old are you?” “I’m sixteen.” “Interesting.” Sam craned his neck back to the guard. The guard looked away and shifted his feet. Disgust rooted itself in Sam’s gut. “Very interesting.” Taylor is clearly uncomfortable near this dude, and I don’t like the way he talks to her at all. Sam reasoned that Taylor probably only took him down to use his capture as an excuse to be near Sam. Perfectly reasonable, and now that I think I know what she’s doing, I can help her… “Here, Taylor, give me those cuffs. I’ll show you how you put them on a prisoner,” the guard stepped over Sam, who had to strongly fight the urge to trip him, and reached out to Taylor. She quickly tossed the cuffs to him so he didn’t have to walk any farther. “Thanks, Boyer!” she enthusiastically said, emphasizing his name. She prattled on about how she hasn’t gotten the chance to use them yet, during which Sam mouthed ‘now?’ She shook her head, turning her shaking into excited nodding and an exclamation as Boyer glanced at her and overly explained the latch on the cuffs. “And then, all you gotta do is-” Boyer turned his back to Taylor and leaned over to Sam’s hand. Taylor screwed up her face, lifted her foot, and kicked Boyer. Sam rolled out of the way as he toppled forward, his face smashing into the slushy dirt-snow. Boyer groaned but recovered quickly and swept his leg wide, trying to catch Taylor’s ankles. She easily lept over his clumsy kick, her braid majestically arcing mid-air again, then bouncing in between her shoulder blades as planted a knee next to Boyer and repeatedly slugged him, pummeling him deeper into the dirt. Sam restrained a gleeful cackle at the sight. His humor had gone from dark to morbid while at the manor. Another group of screams rent the air. Sam was jolted back to reality. He got up, dusted himself off, and collected himself a bit before he cut in between Taylor and Boyer. “Excellent form, Taylor,” Sam gently put his palm on her shoulder. She froze with a jerk and blinked, like she was surprised. She slowly stood up, shaking out her fists, and Sam swooped in with exaggerated sarcasm: “Here, Taylor, this is how you put on handcuffs! I’ll even give you a demonstration!” Sam efficiently cuffed Boyer, who still pitifully laid in the mud, and told Taylor to grab one of his hands; he was coming back to the camp with them one way or another. His cowardice, nor his condescending mannerisms to Taylor, were not going to be rewarded. “Who is he, by the way?” Sam asked while prepping for their slogging in the mud by yanking Boyer’s wrist. Taylor chuckled when Boyer did not immediately belch out an answer. “Firstly, he’s a positively adamant supporter for Odin’s ideas. Secondly, he’s a disgusting creep, and thirdly, he’s got no backbone-” “I’ve got enough back for ya to stab it,” Boyer replied. “Sorry, what was that? Couldn’t hear you, buttface,” Taylor replied in her over-sweetened voice. “I am your captain! Treat me with respect, brat!” Boyer lifted his head to passionately yell around filth caking his lips. “I called you a backstabber!” Taylor dropped his wrist and lunged for a nearby tent-stake. “Want to make that literal, or keep it figurative?” she asked in a dangerously lowered voice. Boyer glared, but did not have an answer for her. “That’s what I thought.” “Alright Taylor, we’ve got to drag this lump thirty more feet. Stick with me,” Sam gently reprimanded her. He was keenly, painfully, aware of how much time this mess had used up. Precious time. The fine grains of precious time sifting away through the gaps in Aspen’s plan; she nor anyone else could have known which people at the manor would create problems. “Sorry, Sir.” “Sam,” he offered her. They walked closer and closer towards the center of the camp. When Sam could faintly see a golden glow of the bonfire through the canvassy sea, he paused and lifted a finger to his lips. Not like silence would matter much anyways, as Sam could clearly hear Adonis yelling for order and children screaming and the guttural sounds of fighting, but Taylor nodded and stopped as well. She patiently watched Sam for more cues. He gently placed Boyer’s wrist on the ground and peeked around the tents. He vacillated between just joining the fight or trying to make an entrance. Boyer looked between Taylor and Sam. Taylor was watching Sam, and Sam was watching the middle. He noticed their careful silence. So, Sam’s decision was made when Boyer drew in a deep breath and bellowed as loud as he physically could. Sam whirled around, hooked a hand in Boyer’s armpit, and forcing all his energy forwards, threw Boyer straight into the side of the tent they were hiding behind. Boyer was a fantastic wrecking ball. The canvas caved in, tent poles snapped, whatever was inside the tent cracked loudly, and both the children and adults screaming and fighting in turn were shocked to stillness. Taylor crossed her arms and smirked at them. Sam stepped over Boyer’s limp form, gesturing at him with a point, and said in a booming voice, “Guards! This is your captain! This is an order to cease fighting this second, or you will be punishable by law! Children, you are going to be escorted out of camp and taken to a safe location! We are not working for Odin, you will be safe with us, understand?” His answer was two-hundred-odd open-mouthed faces staring blankly at him. The agents quickly took down the rest of the guards. Sam put on foot on Boyer’s back to prevent him from moving any more, and fiercely monitored the children. He knew that the younger ones were likely terrified beyond their wits, but he hoped that some of the older teens in the group would be willing to trust and maybe even help the agents. Taylor leaned up to Sam’s ear and murmured something while pointing around the circle. “Wait! Those seven right there, yeah the one with black hair too, those guards can be released!” Sam called out to the agents. He subtly nodded to Taylor. “Thanks. We’ll take all the help we can get.” Taylor gave him a thumbs-up. She was glad that she took the time to get to know the other guards, because now she knew exactly who to trust. Only four guards, not including Boyer (who she hated with a burning passion for multiple reasons), were the ones who were ‘questionable at best.’ They weren’t trustworthy, but taking those few down was laughably easy; Taylor knew the guards here were barely guards at all. Mostly, they were just unwilling glorified nannies. Taylor watched the agent’s efficiency with fascination. Their formation had allowed them to completely encircle the camp, and they efficiently pushed everyone right up to the edges of the campfire, like herding sheep dogs. They did it with such ease. And that bothered her immensely. Doubtful questions swirled in her mind. She stepped away from all the action for a moment, wondering, If this was so easy, why didn’t I just do this earlier! I had Finlay on my side, and those friends I pointed out. Are we really all so cowardly we couldn’t stand up for ourselves? For everyone here? And more questions sprang from those, as well as a deep, deep shame. If it was really this easy, we’ve just been making excuses when we could have been making changes to get rid of Odin’s power. Why does he have so much control? If I was willing to fight and I just didn’t because I was scared, then is that what everyone else thinks too? But then, why? How? How did he get all this power!? These words whirled, night after night, day after day, hellbent on finding that sweet release in knowing the answers, and yet never finding it. Her cheeks had flushed with indignant anger just moments ago, but now the hot flush drained away; she was defeated, ashamed. Sure, a great victory had just happened, and she had her moment of heroism when she got to take sweet revenge on Boyer, but it didn’t feel right. Finlay wasn’t here to celebrate with her. There wasn’t much to celebrate, because it’s not a victory to be saved by someone else, but if he was here they would have celebrated nonetheless. Because that’s just how Finlay is. But at least it didn’t feel like the responsibility of saving Briarcliff rested solely on her anymore. Sure, it never was only just her battle, but nonetheless she had taken it on. Her and her conspirator, Finlay. They had spent secretive nights together, whispering ideas of how to attack, formulating plans they both knew would never come to fruition, but were fun to create anyways. Stop that, she scolded herself. Stop circling back to him. It’s distracting you from reality! The night pressed onward, and she and these agents who had just saved her ass ransacked tents for supplies while constantly looking over their shoulders to make sure Odin was not going to materialize suddenly; she knew she needed to be more into the moment, more focused on herself and not the memory of Finlay to be fully present in the moment. Yet her mind would not let go, cycling Finlay, Finlay, Finlay, Finlay, he was a constant thought, a presence. She knew that if he was here, he would say this whole operation was “amazingly, terribly, and most importantly, honorably stupid.” Oh, she missed him so much it wasn’t even funny. Maybe if he was actually physically next to her, the thought of him would not distract her so. Blushing, she smiled and thought she quite looked forward to searching the manor until she found him. Later. For now, she would still have to struggle to focus on herself, her body. Now was not the time for reminiscence. This hastily-invented rescue plan was quickly unfolding before her, and she intended on helping it’s execution the best she could. For herself. For the kids around her. Hell, for the adults too, who were too scared to act. For Finlay. Her efforts were for them."

    "text": "Taylor knew these thoughts scampered haplessly around in their stressed minds. While she sympathized with them, she had no patience and was eager to prove her usefulness to her rescuers. She wanted to be integrally important in Odin’s demise. She placed her hands on her hips, nodding and mhm-ing as Sam commented that pair was being a bit of a nuisance. Their antics kept the whole camp’s attention on them, trickling away precious, precious time one pitiful punch and vocal protest at a time. An idea blossomed in her mind. Raking her eyes around the camp, she suddenly dashed off and wrestled the fabric from one off the collapsed tents off the poles. Running back to the middle, arms full of bunched-up canvas, she saw Sam and the other adults, who hadn’t the chance to introduce themselves yet, approach those two darn kids and try to soothe them, resting hands on their backs, trying to explain what was going on. A hundred watchful eyes, shining in the weak flames of the almost-put-out fire, watched Taylor as she waltzed up, said, “Back off! I got this!” and proceeded to rip the fabric into two sections, quickly straight-jacketing both of the children by tightly wrapping them in the fabric. “There!” she said. She looked around, feeling rather proud and amused by her own resourcefulness, hoping to catch an approving eye in her audience. Sam grinned at her, laughing incredulously. “This solves the problem? A’ight. Okay, to the rest of you,” she spread her hands, spinning one slow circle to encompass\nTaylor, who had no patience, only had to fashion two tent-canvas straightjackets on a pair of especially obnoxious little devils who thrashed their arms and screamed incessantly before the rest of them understood and willingly (or perhaps fearfully) followed her to the forest without any struggle. Taylor was the only familiar person in this mysterious adult-group, so it was only natural that she had such easy authority over the kids. She followed Adonis’ lead as he wound through the trees, slick ground-leaves, and patches of ice, wading through the thick ground cover uphill all the way back to the grate. Two agents lifted the grate, shoving a boulder underneath it to prop it open, dropped in, and helped person-after-person climb down the ladder and assemble in the vestibule below. Taylor extracted a promise from the troublesome pair she had wrapped up in tent canvas: if they wanted to be released, they would have to listen to instructions and not cause any more trouble. She kind of wanted to leave them wrapped up because their little legs trying to waddle fast enough to keep up was really funny, but Adonis would not let her do that, playfully scolding her while she giggled and unwrapped the devils. The troublesome pair of rascals from before were unwrapped by Adonis, who scolded a giggling Taylor while doing it, the stragglers crested the hill and dropped down the ladder, and some of the kids were already being broken into groups and following agents back down the hill as they realized the vestibule was filling far too quickly. Finally, only Prince, Adonis, Taylor, and Sam were standing amongst the forest’s pines. Modestly impressed with their pace, Prince announced that the emptying of the camp had taken them only slightly more than thirty-three minutes. “Don’t jinx it now. You’ve still got to get all of them to the other side of Briarcliff,” Sam half-joked. He shook hands with Prince and said, “See you on the other side of this.” “Yeah. And Taylor, you better keep an eye on those losers, alright?” Adonis nodded at the captured guards who waited beneath the grate. Prince and Taylor were now reassigned to making sure they did not try to contact Odin or trying to escape. “Good luck.” Prince crouched, put his penlight in his mouth and his hands on the edge of the concrete, and swung into the muggy drainage system’s stagnant water with tinkling splashes. Taylor crouched too and placed one foot on the ladder to go down in a less chaotic way than Prince, but she paused. “Hey Sam?” She asked timidly to get his attentionthis sentence is meh. “I know one other guard at the house who is willing to help you guys. His name is Finlay, and he’s fifteen. He’s got, like, the same length of hair as you, and his bangs are cut so they always go in his eyes, dirty blond, and I think he is about five-foot-ten or -eleven. Oh, and brownish-hazel eyes, and freckles on his nose. Just-just so you know there’s others like me. He’s a great guy,” she finished with a smile. The placement of the crinkles from her smile felt like they were in the same places where Sam’s face was cracking. He smiled back tightly and reassured that he and Adonis would look out for Finlay, then said goodbye woodenly and closed the grate behind her. He twisted to Adonis. “Uh-oh.” “Uh-oh,” Adonis agreed. They stared at each other for a second. Odin was, is, will be, wildly unpredictable. Anger at Aspen was expected by both of them, but his reaction? Incalculable. We have to be unpredictable first. We have to be louder, more attention-grabbing, more distracting so he focuses on that instead of us or Aspen or anyone, Sam thought. He had an idea…unfortunately. An idea so sacrilegious, a concept that he hated he even thought of doing, but it would hopefully be crazy enough to stab Odin’s conscious. He fervently explained his idea to Adonis. “Sam, no…no…” Adonis groaned and balled up his hands. “We’re wasting time, Adonis. We have to get the upper hand, and we both know shock works nearly every time.” Sam continued, slower, “I’m sorry that we have to do this to ourselves, but we have to use what’s been handed to us.” Adonis nodded sorrowfully. Sam was right; shock leads to fear, leads to freeze, fight, or flight. “He better freeze, Sam, you better be right, or I swear…” “Got it.” Sam apologized again. Adonis resented his brain as it willed his arm to move, to toss a small rucksack to Sam’s outstretched hand. Sam resented his mind as it willed him to walk through the forest. He was stupid this was stupid this side idea was the worst thing he had ever dreamed up. But maybe it would make this godforsaken night end sooner. Maybe the payoff he hoped for was going to be worth it; maybe he could make Odin freeze long enough, step away from Aspen and Adonis long enough to follow through his own version of ‘the plan.’ The gun still hung heavy in his pocket. Sam almost wished Adonis hadn’t given it back. He exhaled and shook his head. He hated who he was allowing himself to become tonight. He stopped. He looked down. Finlay. A name to you. I am so sorry, Finlay. WTF WTF WTF WTF WTF WTF ???? GET HELP U ****** **** U UGLY DUMB BAD NO ONONONO WHY DID HE HAVE TO DIE WTF Sam lifted his shirt and drew the knife from its fashioned sheath.\n↞⇼↠\nWham! Francis jumped and twisted around at a loud boom. He quickly recovered and said, “Uhh…hello,” to the small upturned face that waited right outside his van door. The girl stared at Francis for long, tense moments. “Dad?” she finally asked tentatively. “Ambar?” Francis whispered incredulously. She didn’t forget us. Francis could have laughed out loud from pure joy as she launched herself through the door and strangled him in a neck-hug. “I’ve missed you so much, Dad,” Ambar whispered. “It was so cold.” “I missed you too, A. More than you even imagine,” he said, gently skimming his fingers over Ambar’s back. “Where’s Coliban? Is he alright?” “Yeah, he’s okay. We got split apart somewhere,” she shrugged. Coliban always managed to get lost, but they’d find him eventually. Francis laughed. “Sure, I’m sure that happened accidentally, hm?” Ambar finally disentangled herself from Francis. “There’s a woman with us who told us to get in your truck, Dad.” Right then, Francis finally saw the clump of shivering kids watching them silently. A couple tween-agers and an agent poked their head around too. “What are you all waiting for? Come on, come on, pile in!” Francis waved his hand. They didn’t need any more encouragement; Francis turned his attention back to watching the road for anyone patrolling while they all dogpiled in the back, drumming the steering wheel. Ambar slid next to Francis on the passenger seat. Once everyone was made comfortable (as comfortable as they could be with thirty people crammed in an eleven-person van), Francis revved the engine and made Ambar buckle her seatbelt. He started the drive to Silver Lake. “Prince, do you copy?” He waited ten seconds then switched to Adonis. “Adonis, do you copy?” Over a crackly connection, Francis heard, “Yes, I copy. We are almost at the Manor’s edge. Radio silence soon. Updates?” a few seconds later. “Waiting on word from Prince. I’m driving to Silver Lake now.” “Good. Oh, you found Ambar and Coliban?” “Yes, sir, I’ve got one of them,” Francis smiled and glanced at Ambar. She blushed and looked away with a ghost of a smile on her lips. “Congrats, man!” His voice cut off suddenly. “Oh, sorry, Sam told me I gotta shut up. Over and out.” “Over and out!” Francis switched back to Prince. He was nearing the edge of the business part of Briarcliff, about to drive past the residential area. So far, only one van had picked up behind him. The main residential area is the last bit of civilized Briarcliff before the wilderness creeps up and takes over again. Francis hesitated, then unrolled his window and stuck his hand out to signal the driver behind to pull over. Prince hadn’t answered yet, and as the head driver, Francis knew he should wait for at least a couple more vans to join the convoy. “Why are we stopping?” someone called from the back. “Because we need to wait for the other vans. I’m sure we’ll only be here a second,” Francis answered while keeping his eyes on the road they had just driven and his hand on the radio’s volume dial. Headlights. Were the golden beams washing over the vans friend or foe? Was Odin still trying to look for Aspen or Adonis or Sam or himself? Friend, Francis concluded as the headlights puttered out and pulled behind the second van. Tip-tap tip-tap. He was drumming the steering wheel again. Another set of headlights closely follows the first, which also switched off as they joined the line. Where is Prince? Francis’ thought summoned him. “Francis, do you copy?” Prince finally radioed. “Yes sir. What’s the delay?” Francis felt pressure settle on his shoulders as thirty perceptive pairs of eyes swiveled to the front at the radio sound. “We have a couple of resistors captured. Continue to the lake.” “That’s all? Alright we’ll-” “Wait. Odin is still trying to find you, specifically. One of his radio signals randomly ran into mine, and I only heard something about killing you. I suggest you go on radio silence after this.” Francis scoffed, then shook his head. “Alright then,” Ambar looked to her father fearfully. Francis saw her look and brushed off Prince’s warning with: “That’s- that’s a delightful tidbit. See you at the top.” “Over and out.” Francis signaled again. The vans prepped, and then followed him closely as he zoomed off. He could not wait until this was all over, and he prayed that Silver Lake was far away enough for Odin to not find him tonight."

    "text": "↞⇼↠\n…Maybe make switch to odin more obvious ???“Hey-! Oh-” I jumped. My hand stayed hovering at where it wasis was just before, resting on the doorknob to let myself in my office. “Hi.”\nI was’m fifteen all over again. Too aAwkward, all flustery because she was she’s way too pretty to be with me, and I kneow it. I’m not fifteen, that was basically ten years ago! I remind myself. Why can’t I say anything? She’s here. She came back. I had so much to say just…just an hour ago…so why..? Eghhhhhh dont love it, like the idea but the wording not so much\nI toreear my gaze away from her stunned face. Aspen’s mouth is hanging open just a fraction, and her eyes are slightly blank, so I know her mind is reeling. With what? How well do I really know my wife? I can only look down, at my hand so self-consciously waiting for the door handle to come back to rest on it. I could brush my fingertip across the back of her hand, I could feel the softness of her hand right now. Sniffing, I push away that and quickly move my hand to my pocket, almost knocking into the wall in my haste to not touch her stable hand. \nSay something. Anything. Literally just spit the first words that come to your mouth- I cleared my throat. “I…I checked out that build you were telling me to in your single-player. It looks really good,” I muttered. She did not care to hear what I had to say. I had lost Aspen. After everything, after all the control I had over every aspect of my life, over every aspect of everyone’s life, Odin had lost it all. “Well, that’s nice,” Aspen replied coolly. “Whilst you did that, I hid from you because I thought you were going to kill me.” “Aspen, I could never kill you. You mean so much to me, and I’ve been doing a lot of thinking-” Aspen’s face switched to disgust mixed with disbelief. A corner of her mouth quirked up, and Jeff cut himself off before he said something stupid. He awkwardly wiped his nose and looked to the floor. Nose wiping part feels a little awkward not that believable !!A LOT OF THIS NEEDS TO BE PAST TENSE!! Aspen twisted back to the office and waved the sword around carelessly, almost catching the tip on the wall. “I’ve been doing a lot of thinking Aspen! I love you Aspen! You know me, Aspen!” she mimicked. “No Jefferson! No, I don’t know you! And whatever ‘thinking’ you’ve been doing could ever explain away what you’ve already done! How do you not see it, man? How-” her throat caught and she sunk onto the edge of the desk in a defeated way. Quietly, she asked, “How far gone are you?” Jeff looked away miserably. He huffed, stepped in, and gently closed the door behind him. “Aspen…” He trailed off, not sure how to finish his sentence. “What? What’s on your mind Jeff, after not seeing me for a couple days? What’s it like without me here for you to yell at?” “You want me to yell at you Aspen?” Odin had a whisper of threat in his voice. “I’m rather tired, but if you really want me to, I’m sure I have just enough energy to scream at you. I would ask you how your days have been, but I’ll bet they sure as hell haven’t been cold! Adonis is a good bed warmer, isn’t he?” ohhhhh shiiiiiiiiii—– Aspen pushed her palms into her eyes. A migraine was threatening to bloom with all these mind games fueling it. “What is your problem, Jeff! I may have run away but I’m no cheater! I can’t-” “Oh, so it’s Sam then, huh? If it’s not one it’s got to be the other,” Odin spat bitterly. His words were vicious, but he still stood awkwardly near the doors, carefully staying out of range of Aspen and the sword. “Sweet mother of….why are we even talking about me? Hah, why are we even talking about ME! HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE YOU KILLED! HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE YOU MURDERED!” Aspen screamed at the top of her lungs, leaping off her desk-perch, the sword clattering loudly to the ground. She was ferocious, lunging at Odin poking him in his chest with her finger, forcing him into the far corner of his office. “DON’T TOUCH ME YOU CHEATING WENCH!” wench feels a little old-englishy? Idk if u want to use a curse word but maybe something more rough and less fancy Odin hurled back, roughly seizing her wrists and yanking her to him. His face twisted murderously. “NO! I am so sick of you pulling this- this-” Aspen screeched in pain as Odin moved his hands up to her improvised bandages and clenched. His face flickered, his eyelid twitched. And he smiled. Aspen cried out again. A sudden black rush flooded from the back of her head and she thought she might pass out. “Odin- I- “Jefferson! You’re hurting me!” good line Jeff’s face relaxed imperceptibly. He let go of her in a flash. Aspen curled around her hands, instinctually arranging her back to face Odin, accidentally leaving herself very vulnerable to him. Odin sighed heavily and rubbed out his forehead with the bottom of his palm. “C’mere, love, let me see your fingers. Let’s go get-” the air whuffed out of him as Aspen quickly stood and jammed her elbow into his stomach. He coughed, half-bent over but refusing to go down, holding his chest?????????????breast with his hand. Aspen gave him no time to recover: whipping around, she lifted her right knee, and screwing up her face?? screwing??, jabbed her heel hard onto the top of his foot. He crumpled to the ground. Aspen stood over him. Watched him struggle to breathe for a few seconds. She turned around, scooped up the wayside sword, and faced him again, slowly turning the hilt around and around in her hands. Odin watched her, his pupils shrinking to pinpoints. He slowly shifted to sitting criss-cross on the floor, one hand still hovering over his breast as he panted. Their eyes burned through each other. Emerald-green depths, hidden behind golden rimmed glasses. Sea, sky, forested depths, framed in dark lashes. Each, both, all, eh welling with tears. “Why,” Aspen coaxed. One syllable. Infinite weight behind it. eh “I’m sorry.” Odin pulled away his hands, staring at the gentle folds of skin creasing each finger and palm. good He dropped them, looking at Aspen again. He shook his head slightly. “I’m so, so, sorry, Fauna.” yesss i like the way u use their names Aspen swallowed. Idk if its on purpose but i like the detail of ‘aspen swallowed’ instead of ‘fauna swallowed’ “I don’t even know what to say, Jeff. Look at us. Look at you. Look at what you’ve done.” Her voice was low, strained. “I know, oh God, I know.” He cussed. “I know! What would my grandfather think now? And my family! Oh God, what have I done?” he groaned. His chest shook. Wait why is he sorry now? Genuinly confused. “Jeff, ‘sorry’ isn’t gonna cut it. This,” she waved at nothing, “is beyond what a sorry could ever fix. Ever.” She still lightly twirled the sword in her hand. Good line “Fau- Aspen-”YESSS he chewed his lip, looking askance at the doors. “It was a pit. It is a pit…I used to stand on its edge but I got yanked in and sank to the bottom and I know I can never fix it, but damn I so wish I could. The farther I went the farther I had to go because after one time I knew I couldn’t go back to the way I was so I had to accept the way I was going and looking back I was such an idiot what was I thinking. Run-on sentence. Maybe split up into little sentences? Like how people are at a loss for words when angry You deserve none of this and I hurt you so many times and I’m so sorry and the children and the families deserved none of this I just went and ruined everything. That’s what I’ve been thinking of, that’s what’s been making me drink so carelessly, I just-” He cut off as Aspen crouched in front of him. She grabbed his chin with her hand, her stomach knotted, her chest hot.her chest what? She glowered at him, rolling her upper lip around her teeth. He sat loosely. Broken. Chipped. Nothing burned in his eyes. Just surprisingly clear, roiling black pits that had sucked him under and were now looking for another victim to enstrangle in the inky depths. She laid the sword on the wood floor, mere inches away from Odin’s hand. And she pulled his lips to hers. Why tho Closing her eyes, she breathed him, leaned into him, pushing his back against the wall. Jeff’s hands omitted the sword, an integral tool to freeing him from this mess, and chose to caress the back of the far more dangerous weapon in his lap. Wait are they sitting now?? A breathing, livingalive weapon. Aspen. Aspen ran her fingers through his hair, pulling him even closer to her. Jeff shifted again, freeing one hand, and trailed her jawline lightly with one fingertip. He rested his palm on her right cheek, scratching the skin right behind her ear where her neck started. Gently moving her lips to his ear, Aspen murmurmered in disbelief, “Hmm, are you trembling, Jefferson?” He pushed her face back to his lips and answered after a pause, “No, of course not.” But his burning blush gave a different answer. Yes, Aspen, I am trembling. For you, only for you. “Maybe you’re the cold one then,” Aspen suggested, teasing. She loved this, every second of this. She scratched his side, drawing her fingers up his ribs. Whispering into his mouth, she whispered “Are you ticklish?” He flinched from her, concealing a grin. “No.” But he carefully pressed her hand down, wrapping it around to his back. Electricity hummed through them. Jeff could feel Aspen’s heart hammering and likewise Aspen could feel his. I miss tenth grade… Aspen longed to escape back to high school. Odin dreamed of making Aspen forget everything that happened in the past year and start fresh. Slam! “They’re in the office by now!” “Shh! Be quieter-” lol Aspen jerked away from Jeff as Adonis’ and Sam’s voices echoed from somewhere in the manor. She crawled away backwards on her palms, ignoring their throbbing through the bandages. She wiped her lips self-consciously as Odin’s attention flickered between the doors and her burning face. The door groaned open. A key of light washed over the floor, then Aspen, then glazed the edge of Jeff’s shoe. Adonis stepped in, looking first at Aspen’s upturned flushed face then at Odin lounging in the corner. Not breaking eye contact with Odin, Adonis stuck out his arm to Aspen, who pulled herself up with it. Odin then surreptitiously(?) tried reaching for the sword discarded at his side, but Aspen quickly grabbed the blade from him. “Aspen? What are you doing?” Jeff asked. Oddly, he sounded genuinely surprised. But his voice twisted to spit when he looked at Adonis and said, “And why do you need to be here? My wife and I were just having a very touching moment. Alone.” “Sounds pleasant. Guess your distraction worked pretty well, huh?” an unfazed Adonis asked Aspen. She nodded sheepishly. Wait still dont get why she would kiss him? Why not just talk?? Wouldnt she not want to kiss him???? Maybe a little too well, she admitted to herself, somewhere in the depths of her mind. She brushed away that string of words like an old, dusty cobweb. OOF “One second, you’re denying your cheating, the next you’re kissing me, and then you’re back with Adonis? What the hell is your problem Aspen? You make me sick,” Odin hissed venomously, double-backing from the vulnerability he displayed seconds ago. “And you, Adonis? Where’s your big companion? Not got much of a tongue without him?” Sam walked through the door too. “Aspen, prepare yourself,” Sam commanded. Forcing his face to stay blank, he produced a misshapen satchel hanging from his side. Sam overturned the bag so the foreign lump inside it fell straight towards Odin’s shriveled carcass of a heart. “Boo,” he said when it landed. A frozen-solid, shriveled and grey-skinned severed hand thumped against Odin’s coat."

    "text": "My God, she is beautiful, Adonis’ mind whispered as his eyes drunk in every detail of her appearance. Her golden curtain of hair swayed with every burst of laughter that escaped her throat, her smile with shining teeth could enchant gods and goddesses alike to her will, her eyes. Their green blue, the dark, long lashes that framed them, the speckles of freckles that sprinkled all across her cheekbones- His heart squeezed as her green irises met his. For once, he didn’t look away. “What?” Aspen whispered, grinning. “Nothing…nothing,” Adonis said, still watching her. “C’mere, I have an idea,” she announced suddenly, hopping up from the floor and holding out her hand to him. She led him up the flights of stairs, stopping once so they could grab a pile of blankets, up to a trapdoor cut into the ceiling. Adonis lept, catching the old-fashioned iron ring embedded into the wood to open the door, revealing a ladder. He clambered on top and reached back to pull Aspen through. They were on the roof of the manor. They kicked an area clear of snow and laid down a blanket. Adonis watched Aspen as she wrapped herself in another, and distantly he heard her call him over to sit with her. Come on, let’s watch the clouds together, she said. She pointed out clusters, adding funny backstories to each of the shapes she illustrated. “Aspen,” he said when her conversation lulled. “Yes?” she asked. Propping himself up on his elbow, he cupped one side of her face. “May I kiss you, Aspen?” he whispered. Her lips parted, her cheeks flushed. And she nodded, meeting his lips halfway with controlled enthusiasm. Time slowed. Butterflies flittered teasingly all inside of Adonis and Aspen. He gently pulled away to kiss her forehead. The clouds, artistic in shape and stoic in face, took no notice of the pair below. The sky turned, the clouds’ rippled edges tinged orange and stars scattered across the velvety blue of the eastern half of sky; but the blush-peach clouds didn’t notice them when the pair laughed at inconsequential jokes, nor when they stopped kissing or talking and just smiled, contentedly staring at each other. But the pair knew. Adonis and Aspen-Fauna knew and noticed and remembered.\nEpilogue: Part II Aspen scrambled up the hill again, the hill at the back of the manor, the hill that blocked the once-beautiful valley that used to be her garden, the hill that she and Adonis and Sam and many others had traversed in order to escape from the manor that one night. That one night. The night she, Aspen-Fauna, had murdered her husband. She tried to shake away the thought. Clutched in her fists, she carried a small wooden box with a swan and a numeral, “II,” engraved into the wood grain. Now at the top of the hill, she breathed deep and let the wind toy with the ends of her hair, staring into the dead valley. It used to have flowers and benches and water fountains. It used to have a hundred kid-prisoners and a sea of tents and campfires. And now it was just dead. She turned left, deeper into the forest, drumming a beat on the box with her fingertips to match her monotonous steps. She stepped over gnarled roots with lichen creeping up the mottled wood, ducked underneath low branches and rocky outcrops, and around soft drifts of white snow that sparkled ominously in the grey light filtering from the dense clouds overhead. Feathery ferns shivered in her wake. Finally, a cluster of boulders presented itself before her, a stack of rocks so precariously piled on one another it was hard to believe they were naturally placed. She climbed onto the peak of the tallest rock remembering how she found it: while walking around one afternoon with Jefferson, exploring to learn this area they, as newlyweds, had just moved to, stumbled upon it and had to stop so Aspen could sketch it into the little book she used to always carry with her. She smiled sadly, bittersweet, a single tear trailing down her cheek to her chin. She spun slowly, admiring the view of the forest from the rocky precipice. A wintry owl swooped a distance away, hooting softly. And that brown flash, down there; was that blur a startled deer sprinting away? Finishing the spin, her attention returned to the reddish box in her hands. Her knuckles gently stroked each bump and groove. Slowly she popped the silver clasp open and lifted the small lid. A breeze lifted, the eddies playing with her hair-tips again. She stuck her arms straight out and overturned the box. Fine dark grey powder drifted away, swirling and dispersing itself quickly into the air, the trees, the forest, the ground. Her brain was silent, foggy. She couldn’t really think for some reason, like she had drifted away too, detaching from her body to watch in third-person. It scared her. Maybe I’m becoming crazy. No. She was simply mourning. Mourning the loss of a murderer. A murderer missing a murderer. Because that’s what you are. A murderer. And a cheater. A fake. Sighing, Aspen plopped onto the rock. The box slipped from her grip and noisily skittered over the edge. She didn’t retrieve it right away, and she thought she might just have leave it there for all eternity before she summoned the strength to get it. The rock wavered in front of her. Am I about to pass out? she wondered as her chest started shaking and the mind-drifting persisted. Reaching up, she touched her cheeks and, surprised, realized she was crying. Tears were making her vision wiggle, distort, bob. Then she broke. The forest rang with her misery. Her confusion. Her loud sobs that refused to stop. She cried, helpless, alone, and still not herself, still not convinced if it was really herself crying so passionately on top of this rockpile, this forest, this mountain. She curled into a ball, rocking as if she could calm herself somehow, stop this pain that stabbed her in the chest again and again just like she had done to Jefferson. Her love, her husband, her forever. A highschool sweetheart that lasted. Her prince. Her everything for so, so many years. Gone. Because of her. A torrent of emotions hit her, slammed her with vicious fury, and bowed down before it, accepting every inch of pain she felt. She deserved it. She was a murderer, a lowlife, a liar, a cheat. She screamed and tore at her face, her hair. She fought herself, her own worst enemy. MURDERER. Had she been crying for five minutes or five years? Who knows? She didn’t. The world couldn’t, because nothing in the world made any sense. How did I get here? Why does his ghost haunt me so? she thought miserably over the roar of the battle her mind fought. The fog was lifting slightly, she was returning to her body, and she wished she wasn’t now because now it hurt more. She lifted her eyes from her fetal position and looked around again, certain that the forest had curdled and died from the disgustingness of her rage and sadness and deep, deep, confusion. But it still stood. The colors were vibrant too. The evergreen trees verdant. The clouds foreboding grey. The ferns and scrub brush, half-dead in winter, still holding onto bits of green. Detritus an earthy brown. Sage-green lichen creeping up on the slate rock beneath her. And, somewhere out there, freckles of grey from the box she had overturned onto the forest.\nIn a whisper, soft and gentle and nothing like the torrent of violence she had screamed at the earth seconds ago, Aspen breathed, “Goodbye, Jefferson.”"
